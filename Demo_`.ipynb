This report concludes my MSc Complex Systems Engineering\\nand Management at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technol-\\nogy.\\nDuring the past 5 months I have immersed myself in one of the newest concepts in the field of data\\narchitectures: the Data Mesh. It was a subject that quickly captured my dedication and enthusiasm,\\nbecause of its new, innovative and above all socio-technical complex character. The exploratory nature of\\nthis study, as well as the overarching need for ’best practices’ from the application environment, ensured\\nthat I had the opportunity to talk and spar with many different experts from all around the world about\\nthis intriguing topic. People who know me well know that this is something that complements my\\nabilities and gives me a lot of joy. Considering this, there had been no graduation project that would\\nhave suited me better than this one. I would therefore like to express my greatest thanks to Deloitte\\nConsulting and in particular Erik Bookholt and Rik van de Beek for making this research possible. You\\ngave me the idea and inspired me to bite into this research, while you were and remained enthusiastic\\nabout the progress we made together. In addition, the TV&A team at Deloitte welcomed me as family,\\nand showed me in the short time available what a great team they are.\\nAdditionally, I would like to express my gratitude to Marijn Janssen and Bert Enserink for their academic\\nguidance throughout the process, and the ability to put me on the scientifically correct path every now\\nand then when I kept thinking too much in practical solutions.\\nThe moment has come for me to officially put an end to my student life, something that is close to my\\nheart, but which I also look back on with warm feelings. In particular, these feelings go out to my dearest\\nfriends, my boyfriend, my roommates, and all the other people who made my time in Delft remarkable.\\nNot to forget my parents and my sweet sister, who have always encouraged me to give the best of my\\nability and who gave me every opportunity to develop myself into the person I am today and the person\\nI’ve aspired to be.\\nDear reader, thank you for reading this report. I hope it provides you with the insights and perspectives\\nyou are looking for, and with the answers to the questions you now have. And don’t worry, if you don’t\\nhave the time to read more than one hundred pages - something that I can well imagine -, there is a\\nscientific article at the end of this report that summarizes the content in just over nine pages.

              " Document(page_content='E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y\\nDue to the increasing amount of data processed within organizations, these organizations are increasingly\\nexperiencing shortcomings in their current monolithic data architectures and their capacity to facilitate\\nthese data operations. The particular limitations cause an increasing demand for a data architecture\\ndesign that can address these limitations. A distributed and domain-oriented Data Mesh architecture\\npromises to address the limitations of current monolithic architectures in terms of scalability, improved\\ndata accessibility, shortened lead times between operations and analytics and improved appointments of\\nownership and responsibility for data. These improvements are promised, based on the design of a Data\\nMesh architecture that is built upon the following four principles: (1) domain-oriented decentralized\\ndata ownership, (2) data as a product, (3) self-serve data platform, and (4) federated computational\\ngovernance. This research focuses on the assessment of organization readiness for the migration to a\\nData Mesh architecture.\\nConsidering the novelty of the Data Mesh concept, there is a lack of understanding of the required\\nlevel of preparatory efforts to build readiness for a Data Mesh migration. Seeing that the process of\\nmigrating is not as simple as implementing a new tool or feature, it needs to be thought through\\ncarefully before it can be carried out (Furia, 2021; Schultze, 2020). Moreover, literature currently does\\nnot provide a suitable Data Mesh readiness framework, making it difficult for organizations to make a\\nwell-considered choice on when and how to transition (I. A. Machado, Costa, & Santos, 2022a). This\\nresearch addresses this gap in knowledge by designing and developing a Data Mesh Readiness Model\\nthat assesses organizational factors and capabilities that are required within organizations to be able\\nto start their Data Mesh migration. Moreover, the model can provide insights for these organizations\\nabout their current position with regard to Data Mesh migration, as well as outline potential areas of\\nimprovements. The main research question of this study is therefore:\\n“How can organizations assess their readiness for migrating to a Data Mesh architecture?”\\nWhen determining readiness for a Data Mesh migration, the Data Mesh Readiness Model (DMRM) as\\nshown in figure 0.1 offers guidance in assessing the as-is situation of organizations. The model aims\\nto mobilize decision-makers to start their migration by providing insights to what improvement areas\\nto focus on. The DMRM was designed on the basis of theoretical and empirical research towards\\nthe identification of factors influencing Data Mesh readiness. These factors are reflected in a novel\\ntwo-dimensional readiness model, which addresses both the organizational steps towards Data Mesh\\nreadiness and the technological dimensions of a Data Mesh architecture design. The model was applied\\nwithin seven demonstration environments, on which a cross-case analysis was performed in order to be\\nable to compare the performance of the model in practice between the cases. A visual representation of\\nthe Data Mesh Readiness Model is shown in Figure 0.1.\\nThe case-study analysis concerning Assessing the reason to change shows that the demands of an\\norganization that point to a Data Mesh architecture often come from different angles within the orga-\\nnization concerned. In practice, it is often a combination of the Data Mesh needs as identified in the\\nabove-captioned model. Generically, the demands stem from the organization’s ambition to become\\nmore data-driven in the future.\\niv', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Figure 0.1: Data Mesh Readiness Model (DMRM)\\nIn terms of Assessing the ability to change to a Data Mesh architecture, the case-study analysis shows\\nthat the organization needs to meet a number of requirements. One of the most important requirements\\nis a detailed business & IT alignment . Specifically for a Data Mesh migration, the departments within an\\norganization should recognize the value of each other’s operations. In particular, they should recognize\\nthe value of the data that the departments use for their operations. The above largely requires the\\nestablishment of organisation-wide data awareness. The alignment mainly consists of shared awareness\\nof the value and use of data for operations. In addition, among the factors decentralization of the\\ncurrent monolithic platforms and the decoupling of the existing business applications , many different\\nperspectives exist among the participants of this research. Examples of these perspectives are to start\\nwith domains that are eager to be autonomous, and to separate the business application layer from the\\nData Mesh migration.\\nWhen Assessing the preparedness for change , the DMRM enables organizations to review whether the\\nrequired formal structures and guidelines supporting a Data Mesh migration are in place. The case-study\\nanalysis discovered that this stage leans more towards an execution framework than an organizational\\nreadiness assessment. However, since this component contributes to the aim of the model, namely\\nguiding organizations through the preparatory phases prior to Data Mesh implementation, it was decided\\nto maintain it in the model.\\nMoreover, the analysis showed that cross-domain collaboration should be facilitated since it adds to the\\nperformance of the Data Mesh. Additionally, it has been discovered that the design of a governance\\nmodel for a Data Mesh architecture lacks consensus among the participants. Therefore, it has been\\nproposed in this study to conduct further research in this area. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the\\ninter-domain dependencies in the organization should be well thought out before starting the Data Mesh\\nmigration. Finally, the case-studies show that the alignment of the team structures with the business\\ndomains supports the preservation of domain expertise in the teams.\\nWhen Determining Data Mesh readiness , a meaningful insight is that a Data Mesh migration should\\nalways be handled in an iterative way throughout the entire process. It appears difficult to get everything\\nv', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='right in one go, which means that factors earlier readiness phases often have to be adjusted afterwards.\\nAlso, since a Data Mesh migration has great organizational impact on all departments, it should be\\napproached in a structured and organized manner. A model as proposed in this study can provide\\nguidance during this process.\\nFacilitating the testing and evaluation phase of this research, an operationalized artifact of the DMRM has\\nbeen developed in the shape of a self-assessment questionnaire. Both the testcases and the evaluation\\nsessions show that this self-assessment contributes to the usability of the DMRM, due to the factor\\nexplanations and actionable follow-up questions. The insights of these sessions include several future\\nimprovements of the DMRM and the self-assessment instrument, such as the expansion of the model to\\na broader business context and the design of an automated assessment that immediate actionable advice\\nbased on the assessor’s answers.\\nThis research extends the body of knowledge on the academic literature on Data Mesh architecture\\nassessment methodologies by providing a two-dimensional readiness model that can be utilized to assess\\nboth the organizational capabilities as well as the technological implementations required for a Data\\nMesh migration. Moreover, this assessment can also be used as a self-assessment, offering new insights\\nfor customers of the assessment and guiding them in an iterative way through the process of preparing\\nthem for a Data Mesh migration. Reflecting on both the findings as well as the DMRM, it has been\\nrevealed that not all organizations are suitable for a Data Mesh architecture, since the architecture design\\nmainly offers a solution for large and complex organizations that are digital native. Moreover, it seemed\\nthat it is not always necessary for an organization to implement all the Data Mesh principles as a whole\\nto be able to retrieve value out of it. Organizations that remain critical towards the new architecture\\ndesign shall decide for themselves which components address their specific challenges, based on the\\nresults and insights from the DMRM.\\nDue to the exploratory and novel character of this research, further research is strongly recommended.\\nFirstly, a follow-up study could focus on broadening the demonstration environments. Secondly, it could\\nfocus on the design and development of a Data Mesh governance model. Thirdly, a study into the design\\nof a detailed and actionable Data Mesh execution framework is recommended. Finally, further research\\ncould dive deeper into the societal and organizational impact caused by the large-scale implementation\\nof Data Mesh architectures.\\nOverall, this study has discovered that migrating to a Data Mesh architecture is a profound and com-\\nplicated process. This process must therefore be handled in a meticulous and structured manner. A\\ngoverning artifact such as the DMRM can provide actionable handles for organizations that need guid-\\nance throughout this course. This research has lead to the understanding that a Data Mesh architecture\\nmainly revolves around the organizational culture, architectural decisions for moving data, and the sup-\\nporting governance structure. Therefore, the choice of technology is rather an executive decision than\\nan organizational priority.\\nvi', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

              " Document(page_content='1 I N T R O D U C T I O N\\n1.1 context\\nCurrently, our society is in the middle of a digital revolution. This results in a bigger amount of data to\\nbe processed by organizations: research of IBM has shown that more than 90% of all global data has\\nbeen collected in the last five years (Marr, 2018). As a consequence of the ever-increasing amounts of\\ndata collected by organizations, the concept of ”Big Data” has been developed. This concept refers to\\nthe collection and processing of data for various use cases on a massive scale (Einav & Levin, 2014).\\nConsequently, 95% of businesses cite the need to manage the large and unstructured amount of data as\\na challenge for their business (Kulkarni, 2019). In addition to the fact that more and more organizations\\nhave experienced these problems in recent years, it has also become increasingly clear what the value\\nof insights from data can have for their performance. In order to come up with a solution to the\\nproblems, as well as to recognize this value, large investments have been made by organizations in the\\ndevelopment and design of data platforms. The purpose of these data platforms has been to be able to\\nmanage and process the collected data in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner (Dehghani, 2019).\\nBecause these platforms are primarily designed to accommodate huge amounts of data, there was an\\nincreased need for organization-wide data architectures that can be build up around these platforms.\\nThe functioning of the platforms within these architectures should be made possible by technologies\\nthat can recognize the amounts and different types of data (Saddad, El-Bastawissy, M., & Hazman,\\n2020). For a long time, these enterprise data architectures were built as a single pipeline consisting\\nof a single data processing unit, with the data generators at the beginning of the pipeline and the\\ndata operators at the end of it (Selmadji et al., 2020). This way of designing a data architecture is\\nreferred to as a monolithic data architecture design. However, as a consequence to the aforementioned\\nincreasing amount of data to be processed, the ever-growing amount of data analysis techniques, and the\\namount of functionalities it has to address, these monolithic architectures have shown their limitations in\\ndifferent areas such as maintenance and debugging, scalability, maintaining quality data, and ownership\\nand responsibility issues (Khazaei, Barna, Beigi-Mohammadi, & Litoiu, 2016; Khazaei et al., 2016;\\nLawal Moshood, Ileladewa Adeoye, & Lawal Habibu, 2020; Saransig & Tapia Leon, 2019; Selmadji et al.,\\n2020). Thereupon, these limitations result in an overload in the capacity of data teams in response to\\nthe growing needs of the organization (Dehghani, 2022).\\nIn an effort to address these limitations, some developments have already taken place in the field of alter-\\nnative data architectures. Within these developments, the shift from a monolithic towards a distributed\\narchitecture design has played a primary role (Kalske, M ¨akitalo, & Mikkonen, 2018; Lawal Moshood et\\nal., 2020). However, current implementations of these distributed architectures focus on a decomposi-\\ntion of the monolithic unit into different service units, while still little attention is paid to coordination\\nof ownership and responsibility over the data (Newman & Kotonya, 2015) and scalability of the data\\nplatform in terms of the amounts of data to be processed (Fleury, 2021). These long-standing issues\\ncause an unsatisfactory alignment between organizational needs and the functioning of the architectures\\ninstituted (Moses, 2020). As a result, there is a demand for an enterprise data architecture that ad-\\ndresses both technological challenges, as well as the organizational needs of data processing organizations\\n(I. A. Machado, Costa, & Santos, 2022b).\\n1', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='1.1. CONTEXT 2\\nTo overcome the aforementioned limitations of current enterprise architecture designs, a relatively new\\narchitecture design has been introduced, that is built upon earlier distributed architectures but uses a\\ndomain-driven decomposition instead of a service-driven decomposition (Dehghani, 2019; Ray & Pal,\\n2020). In 2019, Dehghani (2019) identified this new domain-driven distributed architecture as a Data\\nMesh, although other scientific publications have suggested a similar approach (Ray & Pal, 2020; Waseem,\\nLiang, Shahin, Di Salle, & M ´arquez, 2021). For the sake of simplicity, this research continues addressing\\nthis new architecture design as a Data Mesh architecture design.\\nA Data Mesh is a domain-driven distributed architecture design, that is all about “recognizing and\\nidentifying data domains in an organization, as well as constructing an architecture based on numerous\\ncomponents that make up these domains” (Hokkanen, 2021). The main goal of a Data Mesh is to address\\nthe problems that arise when scaling data operations in organizations in terms of data availability and\\naccessibility (Dehghani, 2022). The domain-driven design characteristic of a Data Mesh architecture\\ntackles issues when different business units are working on large projects, speaking different business\\nlanguages and formulating different requirements, as can emerge in monolithic architectures (Braun,\\nBieniusa, & Elberzhager, 2021). The bounded context in a domain-driven design defines clear boundaries\\nfor every business domain in the organization, ensuring that domain experts and data engineers within\\nthat domain are working closely together (Braun et al., 2021). The architecture design is made up of\\ndifferent domain components that exist interoperably but independently of each other (Enyo-one Musa,\\n2021). Compared to existing distributed data architectures, the Data Mesh concept mainly revolves\\naround an organizational adjustment of the existing data architecture. This adjustment is made within\\nthe teams (e.g. they become distributed domain teams) and the division of roles within the teams\\n(e.g. data engineers and data owners) (Fleury, 2021). This distributed Data Mesh architecture is built\\nupon earlier alternatives to monolithic architecture and promises a more independent, scalable, and\\ninteroperable architecture comprising of multi-functional teams and a domain-driven data architecture,\\naimed to address the organizational challenges that were neglected by earlier enterprise architecture\\ndesigns (Enyo-one Musa, 2021; Ray & Pal, 2020).\\nImplementing a Data Mesh architecture promises to deliver significant benefits over other approaches,\\nbut the process itself is not as simple as implementing a new tool or feature. Moreover, in order to\\nactually deliver these benefits, all relevant processes, structures, and regulations should be included in\\nthe transition to a Data Mesh architecture. This is a drastic and complex process for organizations\\nthat needs to be thought through carefully before it can be carried out (Furia, 2021; Schultze, 2020).\\nHowever, this process is hampered by the lack of a clear understanding of the required level of preparatory\\nefforts in order to build readiness for a successful Data Mesh migration. In addition, it is still unclear\\nto some organizations whether a Data Mesh architecture can offer a solution for their specific needs.\\nCurrently, literature does not provide a suitable Data Mesh readiness framework, making it difficult for\\norganizations to make a well-considered choice on when and how to transition (I. A. Machado et al.,\\n2022a). This gap in literature is filled by a study that investigates the factors that influence this migration\\nand the necessary capabilities needed within organizations to start this migration. The outcome of this\\nresearch can serve as a way for organizations to test whether they are ready to migrate to a Data Mesh\\narchitecture, or which improvements they still need to implement to prepare themselves for this migration.\\nIn addition, this assessment will give them an indication of potential areas of improvement with respect\\nto a future migration to a Data Mesh architecture.\\nThe scientific relevance of this research can be found in the fact that very little research has been done\\non the concept of Data Mesh, and that consequently there is no scientific shared view on the design\\nof a Data Mesh architecture and its capability requirements (I. A. Machado et al., 2022b). Moreover,\\nlimitations of current enterprise data architectures have been addressed in scientific literature (Khazaei\\net al., 2016; Lawal Moshood et al., 2020; Saransig & Tapia Leon, 2019; Selmadji et al., 2020), as well as\\nthe benefits of a domain-driven Data Mesh architecture over these other architectures (Dehghani, 2019;', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='1.2. RESEARCH GOAL 3\\nFuria, 2021; I. A. Machado et al., 2022b; Moses, 2020; Ray & Pal, 2020), but a detailed overview of\\nspecific architecture requirements addressing these limitations is still lacking. This research aims to fill\\nthe theoretical gap dealing with the migration to a Data Mesh architecture and the way this architecture\\naddresses the limitations of current enterprise data architectures.\\nThe practical relevance of this study lies in establishing a ready-to-use readiness assessment determining\\nthe state of readiness of organisations to migrate to a distributed Data Mesh architecture. Using this\\nreadiness assessment, organizations can assess whether or not they should start migrating to a Data\\nMesh architecture, and what improvements need to be made in order to enable the migration. These\\ninsights can be used by organizations to determine the as-is status of their current data architecture,\\nand whether the necessary degree of features such as scalability and resilience of the data architecture\\nis sufficient for future use (Balalaie, Heydarnoori, & Jamshidi, 2016).\\nThe proposed research is part of obtaining a master degree in Complex Systems Engineering and Man-\\nagement (CoSEM). A CoSEM master thesis is focused on designing in socio-technical systems. Research\\nin the field of data and data management nowadays focuses mostly on the technical functioning of the\\ndata, however recent publications point out that there is a need for a more comprehensive sociotechnical\\nsystems view to realize effective and safe integration of data management and data handling into organi-\\nzations (Stalla-Bourdillon, Wintour, & Carmichael, 2019). This research fits the CoSEM program, as it is\\nfocused on designing a framework that guides organization through the decision-making phase of deciding\\nwhether and how to move the organization into an organization-wide architecture transformation.\\n1.2 research goal\\n1.2.1 Research Objective\\nThis research focuses on the adoption of a Data Mesh architecture in order to address the identified\\nlimitations of current enterprise architecture designs found in scientific literature. This research aims to\\nguide organizations towards a better understanding of their current data architecture status, and whether\\nthe key capabilities of this architecture meet the level needed to migrate to a Data Mesh architecture.\\nThis is translated into the design of a readiness assessment that measures a set of predetermined and\\nscientifically founded capabilities and determines whether these capabilities meet the required level needed\\nfor a Data Mesh architecture. In addition, this assessment enables organizations to identify capabilities\\nthat are still subject to improvement before being able to migrate to a Data Mesh architecture. The\\nresearch objective of this study is formulated as follows:\\n“To develop a framework that enables organizations to assess their readiness for migrating to a Data\\nMesh architecture. ”\\n1.2.2 Research Deliverable\\nThe research deliverable of this study is a readiness model. According to Al-Omari and Al-Omari (2006), a\\nreadiness assessment measures an organization’s ability to undertake a transformational change by means\\nof a systematic analysis, while identifying potential challenges that might arise when implementing new\\nprocedures and structures within the current organizational context. The readiness model indicates\\nwhether an organization is ready to make the transformation, or whether it should enhance or improve\\nsome of the indicated required capabilities. A systematic literature review will be conducted into existing\\nreadiness models, in order to use those as a basis for the model that is designed during this study. The\\nbuilding blocks for the readiness model in this research will be the theoretically and empirically identified\\nfactors that are needed for migrating to a Data Mesh architecture design.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

RESEARCH SCOPE 4\\n1.3 research scope\\nTypically, reasons for organizations to migrate to a distributed system come from issues originating from\\ntheir existing architecture being unable to process its vast amounts of data (Zimmermann et al., 2018).\\nTherefore, it can be presumed that the scope of this research focuses on organizations either experiencing\\nthese problems or foreseeing these problems to occur in the future.\\n1.4 research methodology\\nBased on the research objective, the main research question is formulated below:\\n“How can organizations assess their readiness for migrating to a Data Mesh architecture?”\\n1.4.1 Research Design\\nIn order to formulate an answer to the research question, a design science research (DSR) proposed\\nby Hevner (2010) will be used. This research approach is chosen as it allows for the development of\\ntechnology-based solutions to a relevant and practical problem. It is a qualitative research approach\\nin which the object of study is the design of an innovative artifact that serves as a solution for the\\nidentified problem (Johannesson & Perjons, 2021). In case of this study, a readiness model for Data\\nMesh architectures will be designed. In order to do so, a researcher should develop an artifact for a\\nspecific practice, then distill the experience and information to inspire a broader solution (Johannesson\\n& Perjons, 2021).\\n1.4.2 Research Setting\\nIn order to elaborate on the DSR approach, a Design Science Research Metholodogy (DSRM) be used.\\nDSRM includes a six-step research process with relevant research issues at each step. The phases of\\nthe DSRM are (1) Problem Identification and Motivation, (2) Objectives for a Solution, (3) Design and\\nDevelopment, (4) Demonstration, (5) Evaluation, and (6) Communication. The sub-questions of this\\nresearch are formulated in order to structure the research within the phases. The first phase, “Problem\\nIdentification and Motivation”, acts as a preparation phase for the explorative research. The first sub-\\nquestion, guiding the process through the first phase, deals with the general exploration of a Data Mesh\\narchitecture. By conducting an extensive literature review and performing exploratory interviews with\\nexperts, the main characteristics of a Data Mesh architecture are identified. The first sub-question is\\ntherefore:\\nSQ1 : What are the characteristics of a Data Mesh architecture?\\nThe next phase is “Objectives for a Solution” . Since the proposed deliverable of this research is a\\nreadiness assessment framework, the objectives of this framework must be determined. The objectives\\nof the readiness assessment are organizational factors that influence the readiness of an organization to\\nmigrate to a Data Mesh architecture. These factors can then be used as assessment criteria in the final\\nmodel, which enable testing whether the organization meets the requirements. A first version of these\\nfactors are taken from the scientific literature, and serve as the input for the first theoretical version of\\nthe final model. The second sub-question is as follows:\\nSQ2 : What are the factors that influence readiness for migrating to a Data Mesh architecture?', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='1.5. THESIS STRUCTURE 5\\nIn the next phase, “Design and Development”, the process of designing the artefact begins. For the\\ndevelopment of the readiness model, an modified version of the maturity model development theory of\\nBecker has been followed (Becker, Knackstedt, & P ¨oppelbuß, 2009). A visual representation of this\\nartifact development model as used in this research is shown in figure 1.1 (Becker et al., 2009). This\\nmethodology is chosen since it is based on the DSRM as proposed as the baseline of this research. In\\npreparation for the design of the readiness assessment, a systematic literature research is carried out\\ninto existing and readiness-assessment frameworks. After analysis and comparison, these frameworks\\ncan be used as a basis for the artifact to be designed. By complementing this meta-model comparison\\nby the theoretical knowledge from the former phase and by the insights of several interviews with Data\\nMesh experts, the design constructs can be determined for the first empirically founded version of the\\nData Mesh Readiness Model (DMRM). In addition, refinement sessions will be organized to evaluate\\nthis version. The third and fourth sub-questions are therefore:\\nSQ3 : Which readiness assessments with regard to IT architecture transformation are provided in\\nliterature?\\nSQ4 : How to design a model that guides organizations through assessing their readiness for migration\\nto a Data Mesh architecture?\\nDuring the fourth phase, “Demonstration”, the designed artefact is demonstrated in real-life case sce-\\nnarios. According to Mora, Gelman, Steenkamp, and Raisinghani (2012), efficiency, effectiveness and\\nimpact of artefacts are all context-dependent and can only be fully assessed after deploying the artifact\\nin a practical setting. To facilitate this, an assessment instrument is being developed that makes it\\npossible to perform the readiness assessment within organizations that want to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nframework. This is enabled by conducting a multiple-case study at these organizations. The assessment\\ninstrument is an operational representation of the framework for use in practice. The fifth sub-question\\nis:\\nSQ5 : How can the readiness model be operationalized for practical use?\\nDuring the last phase, ”Evaluation”, the artifact is evaluated through context-different test cases and\\nindividual evaluation sessions. During the test cases, the model is deployed within four different scenarios:\\nboth with and without the researcher’s presence, and within organizations with and without experience\\nwith Data Mesh architectures. In addition, based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which\\ndefines evaluation criteria in the form of perceived usability and perceived ease-of-use (Venkatesh, Morris,\\nDavis, & Davis, 2003), the artifact from this research is also evaluated on these characteristics during the\\nevaluation sessions. The results from both the test cases and the evaluation sessions serve to determine\\nthe applicability of the DMRM in practice. Therefore, the sixth sub-question is:\\nSQ6 : Is the designed readiness model and readiness assessment instrument applicable in practice?\\n1.5 thesis structure\\nThe research questions as proposed in the former section are answered by dividing the research into\\nthree parts: theoretical background, design & development, and demonstration & evaluation. These\\nparts also structure the outline of this thesis. A visual representation of this structure can be seen in\\nfigure 1.2.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

The background knowledge is thus intended to serve\\nas a theoretical foundation for the subsequent chapters in this report. Moreover, since the first research\\nquestion addresses Data Mesh specific characteristics, this chapter also serves as a guideline for formu-\\nlating an answer to this research question. The chapter is build up as follows: first, a generic explanation\\nis given about data. Second, specific data architecture concepts are explained. Third, a Data Mesh\\narchitecture is explained in more detail based on its core principles. Fourth, the Data Mesh architecture\\nwill be positioned relative to existing data architectures, in order to discover the advantages and disad-\\nvantages of this new data architecture design. Lastly, overarching this chapter, a Data Mesh reference\\narchitecture is presented that visualizes the Data Mesh architecture design and its characteristics.\\n2.1 defining ”data”\\n2.1.1 Data as an Asset\\nData a key asset in today’s business environment. It is becoming increasingly important for organizations,\\nas it creates competitive advantage by delivering insight in several analytics such as business performance\\nand other performance indicators (Hagiu & Wright, 2020). It can be gathered by data generation teams,\\nvia applications and user-systems. It is not the data itself that carries value, but this value lies in the\\ninsights that analyzing this data provides. Subsequently, organizations have put efforts into gathering\\nthese insights and utilizing this information to base their decision-making on. For less experienced\\norganizations, this could become a slow, costly and unscalable process (Hagiu & Wright, 2020). This\\nprocess has been accelerated by the emergence of innovative IT advancements such as cloud computing,\\nmaking it much easier for organizations to perform large-scale analyses on the information they have\\ngathered throughout their business units and applications (Hagiu & Wright, 2020). Data has thus become\\nan important foundation of digitization and has also been given the function of being an important\\nbusiness asset. In addition to being a driver of decision-making, data and its analytics have become\\nmuch more functional, and are used by organizations throughout the entire business chain to improve\\ntheir own business performance and gain a competitive advantage over its competitors (Hagiu & Wright,\\n2020). Subsequently, organizations have been investing more effort and funding in improving their data\\nanalytics and data management processes over the recent years, in order to guarantee the quality of\\nthe data itself and the insights it provides. Since the amount of generated data continue to increase, it\\nis very important for organizations to have a solid and well-organized architecture that facilitates these\\nprocesses.\\n2.1.2 Data Pipelines\\nData Pipelines are the infrastructures that enable organizations to process data in multiple formats from\\ndistributed data sources with minimal human intervention. It starts with a data source and ends with a\\ndata sink, where data is moved by the data pipeline from one system or subsystem to another (Munappy,\\n8', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2.2. DEFINING DATA ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS 9\\nBosch, & Olsson, 2020). There are two primary principles when it comes to transporting and processing\\ndata, in sense of processing the data in batch jobs, and storing it on the data platform. The terminology\\nthat is used to describe these principles refer to Extracting, Transforming and Loading (ETL) the data.\\nThis is a process that uses data pipelines to extract, transform and load data into a database that stores\\nthe structured data. The order in this process can be different: some architectures require data to be\\nloaded into storage first and then transformed afterwards, storing unstructured data in the database. It\\ndepends on the data architecture which of these two processes can serve the business best (Engstr ¨om,\\n2020).\\n2.1.3 DataOps\\nData Operations, referred to as DataOps, takes its cue from DevOps, combining the ideas of integrating\\nDevelopment and IT Operations in order to accelerate delivery of changes and increase quality software\\n(Ereth, 2018). DataOps uses the same philosophy, but applies it within the field of data engineering.\\nThe aim of this phenomenon is to emphasize continuous improvement and collaboration among the data\\nteams within an organization. In addition, DataOps aims to boost automated data analytics within orga-\\nnizations and ensure high quality data. It can be described as a combination of technological operations,\\ncultural benchmarks, enterprise system plans, and architectural arrangements (DataKitchen, 2021). As\\nfar as the data pipelines are concerned, DataOps tries to ensure that there is a high degree of automation\\nin the various parts of the organization, where there is plenty of room for incremental change. Ereth\\n(2018) uses the following working definition:\\n”DataOps is a set of practices, processes and technologies that combines an integrated and process-\\noriented perspective on data with automation and methods from agile software engineering to improve\\nquality, speed, and collaboration and promote a culture of continuous improvement. ”\\nThere is a reasonable scientific consensus that DataOps contributes to the flexibility and agility of orga-\\nnizations, and that therefore DataOps can be seen as a data foundation for data-driven organizations in\\nthe future (Atwal, 2020; Ereth, 2018; Munappy, Mattos, Bosch, Olsson, & Dakkak, 2020; Rodriguez, de\\nAra´ujo, & Mazzara, 2020; Sahoo, 2019).\\n2.2 defining data architecture concepts\\n2.2.1 Enterprise Architecture\\nAn enterprise architecture (EA) is the technological and organizational infrastructure that enables the\\nenterprise-wide sharing and processing of data. It is therefore not only an IT asset, but rather a strategic\\nand organizational asset (Chen, Doumeingts, & Vernadat, 2008). The way how organizations arrange,\\nsecure, store and collect data can be governed by an EA (Enyo-one Musa, 2021). Enterprise Architectures\\ncan be seen as the data-skeleton of the organization that enables data analytics in order to conduct\\nperformance measures. An EA consists of many teams, competences, expertise and administrations,\\nsince it aims to arrange all the data assets around the data subjects of the enterprise. By administering\\nstrategic and tactical decision support, a complete and comprehensible EA keeps employees of the\\norganization informed about its data arrangements and operations (Losey, 2004). An EA can therefore\\nalso be seen as a complementary architecture to an IT architecture, in order to govern system-wide\\norganization and business context in which the IT units operate (Chen et al., 2008).\\nIt is critical for companies to understand how data moves through the company, where it comes from,\\nwho processes it, and what information choices may be made on the basis of that data. The EA makes\\nthis public and hence gives a comprehensive picture of the organization’s IT infrastructure. One of', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2.2. DEFINING DATA ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS 10\\nthe major tasks of a strong EA is to create order from IT development and IT chaos. This task is\\nfulfilled by the creation of an enterprise data model and an enterprise process model, both acting as\\nthe preconditions the EA should adhere to. An EA is then implemented as specified in these models,\\nand over time structurally evaluated and iterated in order to maintain its successful output (Losey,\\n2004). Since there exists no single data architecture paradigm that fulfils all the needs of data workflows\\nwithin an enterprise, a lot of complexities from the requirements of interoperability standards from the\\nvarious business units of an enterprise arise when implementing a data architecture (Solano & Jernigan,\\n2012). An EA should both facilitate operational integration on all enterprise levels, as well as other\\nenterprise considerations such as meta data, data security, access control and recovery strategies. It\\nis therefore a very time-consuming and costly operation to implement an EA that integrates with all\\nbusiness operations at the operational level, as well as with other upstream and downstream business\\nprocesses (Solano & Jernigan, 2012). It is understandable that the development of potential designs for\\nan EA has received a lot of attention in recent decades. Due to the rapidly increasing amounts of data,\\ntypes of data and functions of data within enterprises, a strong EA is a necessity to continue to carry out\\nbusiness operations (Lnenicka & Komarkova, 2019). It is therefore not surprising that the developments\\nwithin EA designs are progressing at the same speed as the developments within the data management\\nand analysis techniques themselves.\\n2.2.2 Monolithic Data Architectures\\nAs a reaction on the first advent of data analytics as a means for business operations by organizations, It\\nbecame necessary to adjust these firms’ enterprise structures to the volume of data to be handled (Furia,\\n2021). The first sound EA was built around 1980, when the integration of data units and business oper-\\nations was mostly addressed by implementing a central database and complementary interfacing systems\\n(Vernadat, 2003). As an architecture with a central data team and a monolithic data management,\\nperforming all data operations from and to a single, centralized data platform, this architecture was\\nthe antecedent of the architecture that most organizations would eventually adopt inside their own EA\\n(Enyo-one Musa, 2021). These data platforms frequently consist of a predetermined number of teams\\nwith specific expertise and responsibilities: data is generated by source teams, then flows into a large\\ndata storage that is maintained by data engineers, and data analysts extract this data from the storage to\\nrun their analyses on. This monolithic data platform may be thought of as a centralized storage system\\nthrough which data travels through data pipelines. A typical monolithic data architecture consists of\\na User Interface layer that runs on the end-user’s computer, a Business Logic layer and Data Access\\nlayer that process and analyse the data and finally a central DataBase that stores the data (Kalske et\\nal., 2018). A high-level visual representation of this typical monolithic architecture design is shown in\\nFigure 2.1. Specific forms of these monolithic architectures, such as siloed data warehouses and data lake\\narchitectures, have been the foremost ways of organizing the data architecture of organizations.\\nFigure 2.1: A high-level monolithic application architecture\\nData Warehouse\\nOne type of a monolithic data architecture is the data warehouse (DWH). The concept of a data\\nwarehouse dates from the 1980s, and is therefore one of the earlier variants. Characteristic of a DWH is\\nthat unlike other variants it contains structured data, which is extracted from different sources from the\\noperational plane of the company and is processed by ETL transformations for analytical purposes. A', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2.2. DEFINING DATA ARCHITECTURE CONCEPTS 11\\nDWH is thus a clearly centralized data platform that serves as a central point of collection of structured\\ndata.\\nData Lake\\nA few decades after the emerge of the DWH, around 2010, a new concept of a monolithic architecture\\nwas discovered, namely the Data Lake. A Data Lake differs from a DWH in that it contains unstructured\\ndata in raw format, collected from different sources and often in large volumes. The Data Lake contains\\nunstructured data, which is transformed when the analytics are about to take place on the data. The Data\\nLake aims to integrate massive amounts of data into any format from any source of the organization, or\\neven beyond. This was possible because major developments had already taken place in the orchestration\\nof pipeline management in 2010, enabling the tasks of processing and modifying these huge amounts of\\ndata.\\nLimitations of Monolithic Data Architectures\\nAlthough these monolithic data architectures have been able to perform their function well for the last sev-\\neral years, they come with limited capabilities in terms of scaling, deployment and ownership distribution\\n(Dehghani, 2022; Furia, 2021). To begin with, when the application grows in size, the monolithic appli-\\ncation might be tough to adapt. This is because it is difficult to recruit new developers or replace team\\nmembers in a growing architecture. A monolithic design inhibits developers and engineers from working\\nindependently since all components of the monolithic architecture are dependent on the performance\\nof the other teams earlier in the pipeline (Namiot & Sneps-Sneppe, 2014). Moreover, since monolithic\\narchitectures are centralized platforms, typical issues associated with this centralization occur that have\\nto do with the system becoming highly coupled and very hard to maintain. Since a change made to a\\nsmall part of the application requires the whole monolithic system to be rebuilt, continuous deployment\\nin large monolithic architectures is very difficult (Ponce, M ´arquez, & Astudillo, 2019). Furthermore,\\nthere is a persistent risk of a lack of ownership and responsibility, since various departments manage\\ndistinct data sets without any mutual communication. Because data creation, data transformation, and\\ndata analysis are all separate processes, there is little agreement on the purpose and quality requirements\\nof the data (Furia, 2021). Due to the aforementioned limitations, change implementations in today’s\\nmassive, complex, and rapidly expanding systems with monolithic architectures will be too sluggish and\\ninefficient soon. (Krivic, Skocir, Kusek, & Jezic, 2018). A case study of Zalando, one of the largest\\nonline fashion shops, revealed that monolithic data systems had an obvious ownership problem: as the\\nones who generate the data, the producers have no knowledge what the intended goal of data analytics\\non this data is. On their side, data analysts have no idea where the data originates from, and there is\\na lack of overall ownership and accountability for the data sets (Schultze, 2020). Consequently, there\\nis a lack of organizational scalability: as the volume or kinds of data grows, the platform’s scalability\\nsuffers as a result of the central data storage bottleneck. Schultze (2020) shows that these issues appear\\nin both data warehouses, as well as in data lakes, indicating that it is rather an organizational problem\\nthan a technical issue. Generically, it is affirmed in literature that monolithic data architectures are\\nhighly coupled and difficult to maintain (Ortiz et al., 2022). As a result, the central data platform\\nfaces the danger of cutting between domains, as domain expertise on these designs is dispersed among\\nvarious technical teams on the platform. Because the duties for generating, converting, and analyzing\\nexpertise cut across disciplines, friction, a lack of data quality, and an inability to scale arise (Dehghani,\\n2019; Furia, 2021; Schultze, 2020). As a response to the aforementioned limitations of monolithic and\\ncentralized architectures, distributed architecture designs evolved, aiming to tackle these limitations and\\nserving as a more scalable alternative.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2.3. DEFINING ”DATA MESH” ARCHITECTURE DESIGN 12\\n2.2.3 Distributed Data Architectures\\nIn an attempt to address the limits of monolithic data architectures, several studies emerged into break-\\ning down the centralized architectures in smaller, decentralized components. These distributed data\\narchitectures promised better scalability and a solution for the many organizational challenges that the\\nvast monolithic platforms brought with them. The shift from monolithic platforms to decentralized,\\nmore manageable and more scalable distributed platforms also came in response to emerging concepts\\ndealing with continuous improvement, such as Agile and Scrum. These concepts require a continuous\\ndevelopment of technologies and an iterative way of working, working with many different versions and\\niterations. To make this possible, it is important to be able to easily adapt the components of the\\narchitecture, which was not possible with large monolithic platforms.\\nA microservices architecture is one of the first alternatives to monolith architecture design. A microser-\\nvices architecture is a distributed, modularized architecture made up of a collection of discrete, networked,\\nand interoperable services, each with its own unique purpose and access to its own database (Ortiz et\\nal., 2022). Each of these small services, in further particular, operates its own operations and connects\\nwith one another via lightweight mechanisms. They are based on business capabilities that might be\\nused independently (Zdun, Navarro, & Leymann, 2017). The most major benefit of this architecture\\ntype over a monolithic design is agility, which is provided by modularized complex and resilient systems,\\nallowing for speedier deployment of new solutions or upgrades to existing solutions (Nadareishvili, Mitra,\\nMcLarty, & Amundsen, 2016).\\nHowever, although microservices designs are promising in terms of scalability and deployment improve-\\nments, they still have not solved the issues around the lack of ownership and responsibility (Avci Salma,\\nTekinerdogan, & Athanasiadis, 2017). Because of the persistence of scattered domains, the organiza-\\ntion’s domain expertise is still spread throughout the data architecture as a whole, and the problem of\\nlack of ownership persists (Hokkanen, 2021). As a result, a microservices design also leaves challenges\\nin the field of efficient data utilization.\\n2.3 defining ”data mesh” architecture design\\nA Data Mesh is a domain-driven distributed architecture design, that is all about “recognizing and\\nidentifying data domains in an organization, as well as constructing an architecture based on numerous\\ncomponents that make up these domains” (Hokkanen, 2021). The main objective of a Data Mesh is\\nto eliminate the challenges of data availability and accessibility at scale (Dehghani, 2022). The domain-\\ndriven design characteristic of a Data Mesh architecture advocates the establishment of independent\\ndomains in the architecture, working autonomously on their own data. This means that these domains are\\nfree to work on their own datasets and create their own data analytics, as long as they adhere to the global\\ngovernance standards. Subsequently, this design aims to tackle issues when different business units are\\nworking on large projects, speaking different business languages and formulating different requirements\\nfor that project, as is happening in monolithic architectures (Braun et al., 2021). The bounded context in\\na domain-driven design defines clear boundaries for every business domain in the organization, ensuring\\nthat domain experts and data engineers within that domain are working closely together (Braun et al.,\\n2021). The architecture is thus consisting of domain-driven components that operate interoperable and\\nindependently of each other (Enyo-one Musa, 2021). It is essentially an organizational change of current\\nenterprise data architectures, rather than a technological transformation, in which the main focus lies\\non distributed data domain teams consisting of domain-specific data engineers and data owners (Fleury,\\n2021). This distributed Data Mesh architecture is based on earlier alternatives to monolithic architecture\\nand promises a more empowered, scalable, agile architecture with multi-function teams and a domain-\\ndriven business structure, aimed at addressing organizational challenges that were overlooked by previous', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

Figure 2.2 gives a simplified\\nrepresentation of a Data Mesh architecture design.\\nFigure 2.2: Data Mesh Architecture Design\\nThis section dives deeper into the concept of a Data Mesh architecture design and defines its charac-\\nteristics, design principles, advantages and challenges. Moreover, a reference architecture is designed in\\norder to give a visual representation of the architecture design.\\n2.3.1 Characteristics of a Data Mesh architecture design\\nAs proposed by Dehghani (2019), a definition of a Data Mesh is formulated as follows:\\n”An intentionally designed distributed data architecture, under centralized governance and\\nstandardization for interoperability, enabled by a shared and harmonized self-serve data infrastructure. ”\\nA Data Mesh is built upon four core principles, which are a combination of existing ideas on Distributed\\nArchitectures and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) (Dehghani, 2022). The principles are discussed in the\\nfollowing part of this section.\\nPrinciple 1: Domain-Oriented Decentralised Data Ownership and Architecture\\nThe first principle deals with decoupling and decentralizing the traditional monolithic data platform into\\na distributed variant. This decentralization is domain-oriented: that is, the decentralized components\\nof the former large whole are selected on the domain they carry within the organization (Goniwada,\\n2022). The motivation behind this idea is about placing the ownership of analytical data for business\\ndomains close to the data itself, so that the processing, managing and analysing of the data can be\\ndone independently by the domain teams itself (Dehghani, 2022). The domains host and serve their\\ndatasets in an easily consumable way, while being close to the point of destination of the data (Serra,\\n2021).\\nWhen building this decentralized ownership into a data architecture, each domain must be able to\\nindependently implement its own data solutions, instead of having one centralized IT team that performs\\nthese deployments organization-wide. In terms of architecture, this means that each domain provides\\nits own APIs, as well as an analytical data endpoint (Genovese, 2021). In this way, the domains can\\nserve their own analytical data, without being dependent on other domains. Only when organizational', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

DEFINING ”DATA MESH” ARCHITECTURE DESIGN 14\\ndependency arises between domains, i.e. one domain depending on operational information from the\\nother, an output port can be built in that serves simultaneously as input port for the other domains\\n(Genovese, 2021).\\nPrinciple 2: Data as a Product\\nThe second principle deals with the way data is viewed within the organization. Where data in the earlier\\ndata architectures was mostly considered to be a huge data repository, in a data mesh data is considered\\nas a product that is ready-to-use for analytical purposes. Since the data in a Data Mesh becomes a prior\\nbusiness asset, the Product Thinking approach is applied to the data in a Data Mesh (I. A. Machado\\net al., 2022b). This approach sees data as a product, and this product needs to have a set of certain\\ncharacteristics that maintain the quality of the data and the efficiency of the Mesh (Dehghani, 2022).\\nThese characteristics are in scientific literature formulated as the DATSIS principles: the data must be\\nDiscoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-Describing, Interoperable and Secure (I. Machado, Costa,\\n& Santos, 2021).\\n•Discoverable\\nFor data to be discoverable, a central catalogue should exist within the company in which data\\nowners must be able to register their data product in using some search engine, users can request\\naccess to the desired data products (Rigol, 2021).\\n•Addressable\\nHaving addressable data means defining standardized metadata that should be defined for every\\ndata product. In that way, data analysts are autonomous in finding and using the needed data,\\nbut data engineers have less interruptions from people asking where they can find specific data\\n(Rigol, 2021).\\n•Trustworthy and Secure\\nTrustworthiness can be captured in regularly checking the data quality and specific trustworthy\\ncharacteristics of the data products within the enterprise. In order to adhere to security standards,\\nthese checks should be conducted automatically (Rigol, 2021).\\n•Interoperable and Self-Describing\\nIn order for datasets to be self-describing it is important that they use the same naming conventions\\nand contain understandable metadata, which enhances the interoperability of the datasets (Rigol,\\n2021).\\nA data product usually is a published data set that can be accessed by other domains. Each data\\nproduct can be managed independently of others, enabling them to be autonomous. In addition, the\\ndata products provide clearly and logically formulated data sharing contracts to ensure that the above-\\nformulated characteristics of data products are guaranteed. Since these data products contain all the\\nspecifications needed to be managed autonomously within the organization, the components of a product\\nalso cover all the structural components needed to share data autonomously. For this, a product needs\\nto contain (1) code on how to consume, transform and serve upstream data via pipelines, (2) data and\\nmetadata that can be served as events, batch files, relational tables or graphs depending on the nature of\\nthe domain data but maintaining the same semantic, and (3) an infrastructure components that enables\\nthe data product’s code to be built, deployed, and executed (Genovese, 2021).\\nPrinciple 3: Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform\\nIn order to enable the domain’s cross-functional teams to share their data, a self-serve platform must\\nbe built into the Data Mesh (Dehghani, 2022). This platform is built and maintained by the central', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2.4. DATA MESH RELATIVE TO EXISTING DATA ARCHITECTURES 15\\nIT organization, is domain agnostic and must enable users to surface data lineage across the Mesh. In\\naddition, this platform enables users to control the full life cycle of individual data products, as well as\\nto manage a reliable mesh of interconnected data products (Dehghani, 2019).\\nA few examples of these self-serve data infrastructure planes are proposed, such as a typical data product\\ndeveloper’s main interface that manages the lifecycle of data products using simple declarative interfaces,\\nor a set of global capabilities best offered at the mesh level in the form of a graph of connected data\\nproducts (Genovese, 2021).\\nPrinciple 4: Federated Computational Governance\\nThe last principle deals with the construction of a federated and global governance among the Data\\nMesh. Since one of the main limitations of the former monolithic architectures deals with a lack of\\nresponsibility and ownership, these two capabilities need to be clearly defined while still allowing room for\\ninteroperability, standardization and ecosystem-thinking. Interoperability allows other data teams to use\\ndata products in a consistent way, for example by having policies that define CSV files as the standard way\\nto provide data. Standardization efforts are documented in order to discover and understand available\\ndata products consistently. An easy way to allow for this documentation is to provide an accessible\\ndocument that contains a predefined set of information on the data-owner, location URL, descriptions\\nof the CSV fields et cetera. Since the Data Mesh is distributed into single self-serve domain teams,\\nthese teams can make local and independent decisions on their own data processing and analyzing units.\\nHowever, these decisions must adhere to global rules as defined by the global governance. In order to\\nmaintain interoperability and discoverability of data products and data sets, these global standards are\\ndefined by the ecosystem governance system in terms of how the data is defined (Genovese, 2021; Serra,\\n2021).\\nThe organizational structure of this federated governance and global standards is challenging, but im-\\nportant for the functioning of the Data Mesh. The governance needs to set global rules on local data\\npractices and decisions, and consists of principles underpinning the scope of the global governance. More-\\nover, the global governance is lead by a team that consists of members of the group from the domain, the\\nself-serve platform and global compliance stewards that both have global and local incentives. Moreover,\\nthe global decision standards contain platform capability automating the decisions and computationally\\nvalidating it continuously across all data products and domains (Dehghani, 2022).\\n2.4 data mesh relative to existing data architectures\\nSince the Data Mesh concepts are not widely presented in scientific literature, the comparison between\\nthe Data Mesh architecture concept and existing distributed architectures is made to elaborate on the\\nposition of Data Mesh relative to these existing concepts.\\n2.4.1 Differences Data Mesh Architecture and Existing Architectures\\nStarting with the comparison to a microservices architecture , the Data Mesh architecture idea has\\nborrowed some major concepts from this architecture design. Similar to microservices, the Data Mesh\\narchitecture encourages polyglot technology solutions for each data product instead of for different\\nservices (Balalaie et al., 2016). In that way, the Data Mesh architecture can be seen as an extension of\\nthe characters of the well-established microservices architecture, build upon a domain-driven design in\\na distributed manner, but strongly focused on the domains and the responsibilities within the domains.\\nThe microservices architecture advocates the design of the data architecture based on the decomposition\\nof the monolithic application into loosely coupled and independent components (Dragoni et al., 2017).', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2.4. DATA MESH RELATIVE TO EXISTING DATA ARCHITECTURES 16\\nThis idea originates from the earlier concepts of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) , which is\\nthe predecessor of the microservices design. However, within the microservices design, each service is\\noperationally independent from other services and communication is only possible through published\\ninterfaces (Dragoni et al., 2017). In that, SOA is an enterprise-wide approach which considers the entire\\nenterprise as scope for comprising the system, whereas microservices considers the application-level as\\nscope (Blanco, Kotermanski, & Merson, 2007). The Data Mesh concept distinguishes itself here by\\nusing the domain level as scope. A visual representation of a Data Mesh architecture relative to other\\ndistributed architectures is given in Figure 2.3.\\nFigure 2.3: Various existing distributed data architectures\\n2.4.2 Benefits Data Mesh with Respect to Other Architectures\\nThe benefits of Data Mesh have been widely reported on various gray literature sources. A Data Mesh\\narchitecture improves the accessibility of data, because the data products of domains are published in a\\ndiscoverable way on a platform that is accessible to everyone in the organization. In addition, the data\\nproducts must meet certain interoperability standards, so that the information contained in the data\\nproducts is both understandable and usable.\\nIn addition, the Data Mesh architecture aims to shorten the lead time between the operational data\\nengineering teams, and the analytical data teams, simply by bringing them together in one domain. By\\nbringing these teams closer together organizationally and performing the ETL work for only a domain-\\nrelated amount of data, the bottleneck that existed in the central data platform will disappear.\\nFinally, the Data Mesh architecture advocates a clearer and more logical appointment of ownership\\nover the data products over the architecture as a whole, by placing this ownership per domain-related\\ndata products with the domains themselves. Where the traditional centralized Data Lakes and Data\\nWarehouses contain all data of the organization as a whole, and there was therefore no clear ownership\\nof the data, it seems to be clearer in the Data Mesh which data belongs to which domain specifically\\n(Saurabh, 2021).\\n2.4.3 Limitations of Data Mesh with Respect to Other Architectures\\nAlthough the limitations of the Data Mesh are much less discussed, there do exist challenges that arise\\nin a Data Mesh specifically that are not or less present in the more traditional architectures. Firstly,\\nthere is a much greater need for data specialists within a Data Mesh architecture. Examples of these\\nspecialists are people who have the skill sets to deal with ETL operations, data tools and other technical\\nactions that were initially done by the central data team. In a Data Mesh architecture, instead of a\\ncentral team, these actions are performed by every domain in the architecture, simply requiring more of\\nthese people or an expansion of the skill set of the established people.\\nIn addition, the Data Mesh architecture places a lot of emphasis on an independent approach to generat-', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2.5. CHAPTER CONCLUSION 17\\ning, analyzing and sharing data within the architecture, where these applications have previously always\\ndepended on a central data team. However, there will always be a need for a central body within the\\nData Mesh, and the boundaries between the dependencies of the central team and the independences\\nof the domains themselves can sometimes be vague (Saurabh, 2021).\\nFinally, without proper alignment of the interfaces of the different business domains, there will exist unin-\\ntegrated data silos in the domains themselves, because the domains will publish and share the processed\\ndata products only with the other domains. With these unintegrated data silos, there is a great risk of\\ncreating multiple copies of data if this data is also needed for applications within other domains, which\\nin turn can be a problem in terms of data latency. The risk with these copies is that the moment a\\nchange is made close to the source of the data, it can cause major problems in the data quality of more\\ndownstream applications of this data within other domains. These cross-domain issues and dependencies\\nwill first have to be solved with, for example, extensive data virtualization solutions.\\nIn conclusion, a Data Mesh architecture should primarily be seen as a socio-technical approach for solving\\ncontemporary problems with the accessibility, management and analysis of data within large and complex\\norganizations. The organizational challenge primarily consists of changing the way of thinking, namely\\nabout data as products, and the way of working, namely with a high degree of self-service (Goetz, 2022).\\nAlthough this is more of an organizational issue than a technological issue, technology is needed that can\\nmake this possible and prevent the organizational chaos in a distributed architecture. The aim of this\\ntechnology should be to support and enable the various principles of the Data Mesh, while complying\\nwith a well-thought-out and partially federalized governance model that enables the Data Mesh and\\nstructures and organizes its decentralized nature.\\n2.4.4 Reference Architecture Data Mesh\\nFigure 2.4 shows a simplified reference architecture of a Data Mesh design. It shows an overarching\\nfederated governance structure containing global standards, which influences all independent domains\\nin the Mesh. Within the domains, both operational data products and analytical data products are\\nprocessed. The domains are served by self-serve data platform services that enable the enterprise-\\nwide interoperable sharing of the data products. Within these domains, several data products exists.\\nFirst of all, operational data is often ingested as raw and unstructured data, stored in some kind of\\ndatabase. Analytical data is the operational data after it has been cleaned and structured for analytical\\nuse. Moreover, domains can integrate data products from other teams as external data with the use of\\nthe aforementioned data governance policies. The final data product that is published by the domain is\\nderived by aggregating all the data within the domain, after which it can be stored in the organization-\\nwide data catalog.\\n2.5 chapter conclusion\\nThis chapter presented the concepts about and related to the Data Mesh architecture design, in order to\\nserve as practical background knowledge of this research. This background knowledge provided a theo-\\nretical foundation for the subsequent chapters in this research, and generated an answer to sub-question\\n1:What are the characteristics of a Data Mesh architecture?\\nThe Data Mesh architecture is explained based on its core principles. Moreover, the Data Mesh architec-\\nture was compared with other existing architectures, specifically with the Service-Oriented Architecture\\nand the Microservices Architecture. With domain level as a scope and a strong emphasis on indepen-\\ndent domain teams, the Data Mesh architecture primarily distinguishes from these architectures on an\\norganizational level.\\nWith respect to benefits and limitations of the Data Mesh architecture relative to the other distributed\\narchitecture design, the benefits primarily lie in an improved accessibility of data, a shortened lead time\\nbetween operational and engineering teams, and a clearer and more logical appointment over the data', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

The process of designing the model\\nis structured in three parts.\\nFirst, existing literature is reviewed to identify generic factors that influence the readiness of organizations\\ntowards major IT transformations. Additionally, 13 exploratory interviews with Data Mesh subject-matter\\nexperts are conducted to complement this set with factors that specifically address readiness towards\\nData Mesh architectures. The identified factors serve as the building constructs of the DMRM.\\nSecond, existing literature is analyzed to design a theoretical structure that captures these factors in a\\nstructured manner. These two activities end up with a first version of the DMRM.\\nThird, this first version of the DMRM is evaluated in practice, in order to conduct a last refinement on\\nthe model before proceeding to the next phase in this research. These refinements are performed on the\\nbasis of the insights from three individual subject-matter expert refinement sessions and the consensus\\nfrom a panel session consisting of 26 Data Mesh subject-matter experts.\\n3.1 part 1: constructs of the dmrm\\nThe answer to sub-question 2 is captured in a conceptual framework, visually presented the identified\\ndimensions and factors from scientific literature. This conceptual framework forms the base of the\\nreadiness assessment that will be empirically evaluated later in this research. In order to develop this\\nconceptual framework in a structured manner, design choices have to be determined. In order to gain\\na clear overview on influencing factors within all facets of the organization, the conceptual framework\\nmust contain the following components (Fraser, Moultrie, & Gregory, 2002):\\n•a number of dimensions that address the various organizational facets;\\n•a number of factors that correspond to the dimensions;\\n•a generic description of the factors.\\nAccording to De Bruin, Rosemann, Freeze, and Kaulkarni (2005), the identification of domain compo-\\nnents, i.e. dimensions, can be achieved through an extensive literature review. Therefore, the conceptual\\ndimensions and factors that determine organization readiness towards Data Mesh adoption are extracted\\nfrom literature in order to form a conceptual basis of the readiness assessment. By means of devel-\\noping this basis, all facets of an organization that can be of influence on its readiness, including both\\norganizational and technological factors, need to be included.\\n19', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

PART 1: CONSTRUCTS OF THE DMRM 20\\n3.1.1 Dimension Identification from Existing Studies\\nFirst, the relevant dimensions were identified that address organizational facets within organization readi-\\nness. In order to structure the search for these dimensions, existing literature on readiness assessments\\nwas analyzed and investigated for similarities.\\nThe existing studies that capture organization readiness within several dimensions were analyzed (Bala-\\nsubramanian, Shukla, Sethi, Islam, & Saloum, 2021; Barham & Daim, 2020; Chanyagorn & Kungwan-\\nnarongkun, 2011; Hussein, Mahrin, Maarop, & Abu Bakar, 2020; Joshi, Pratik, & Podila, 2021; Mirarab,\\nFard, & Kenari, 2014). From these studies, relevant dimensions capturing organization readiness were\\nextracted and compared to each other. A complete table with these studies, their context and their\\nidentified dimensions can be found in Appendix C. In total, seven studies were analyzed.\\nIn addition to the analysis of existing readiness assessment frameworks, the Technology-Organization-\\nEnvironment (TOE) Framework is used as a basis for identifying the factors of the readiness assessment.\\nThis framework was developed by Tornatzky, Fleischer, and Chakrabarti (1990) and distinguishes three\\ndifferent dimensions of an organization’s context on which the adoption of a technology can be tested:\\ntechnological factors, organizational factors and environmental factors. Because this study is located\\nin a multi-actor arena with different stakeholders, it is important to take into account all important\\ndimensions in the readiness of an organization. The TOE framework provides an important guideline for\\ndrawing up these dimensions. In addition, it was decided to use this framework because it is independent\\nof firm-size restrictions (Wen & Chen, 2010), which is important for this study because no restriction\\non the size of the organization was chosen. In addition, it is a framework that is widely used in scientific\\nliterature on implementation and adoption processes of technologies (Cruz-Jesus, Pinheiro, & Oliveira,\\n2019) and its use has been widely validated in the field of usefulness and reliability (Gangwar, Date,\\n& Ramaswamy, 2015). In this study, the framework will be interpreted within the research context\\nand will therefore be slightly modified, but will serve as a basis for establishing the dimensions of the\\norganizational context in which the readiness assessment is designed.\\nAfter comparing and evaluating the existing readiness assessments and the theoretical TOE framework\\nas presented above, six dimensions were formulated that structure the conceptual framework on Data\\nMesh readiness.

A visual representation of these factors is shown\\nin figure 3.1. A detailed table on the identified factors and the underlying scientific sources is given in\\nAppendix C.\\nCulture & Competences\\nThe dimension Culture & Competences consists of factors that deal with the internal culture and the\\ncompetences of the people associated with the organization. The way this dimension is designed is of\\ninfluence on the success of migration (Hussein et al., 2020). It is the driving factor behind the motivation\\nof transitioning to a different data architecture design. This dimension includes the following factors: a\\ndesire to transition (Chanyagorn & Kungwannarongkun, 2011; Hussein et al., 2020), the existence of a\\nlearning culture (Al-Ammary & Saleh, 2021; Bahadorpoor, Tajafari, & Sanatjoo, 2018; Barham & Daim,\\n2020; I. Machado et al., 2021), a change management strategy (Goniwada, 2022; Henry & Ridene, 2020;\\nPriebe, Neumaier, & Markus, 2021), engagement of the top-management (Al-Ammary & Saleh, 2021;\\nBahadorpoor et al., 2018; Barham & Daim, 2020; Chanyagorn & Kungwannarongkun, 2011; Hussein et\\nal., 2020) and a basic level of data literacy (Genovese, 2021; Goniwada, 2022; Hazel, n.d.; I. Machado\\net al., 2021; Ore ˇsˇcanin & Hlupi ´c, 2021). The identification of these factors enables organizations to\\ninterpret the reason for the desire to migrate into a different design for their data architecture. Before\\nstarting to transition, organizations will have to indicate which of these factors are driving forces behind\\ntheir willingness to transition into a Data Mesh architecture.\\nResponsibilities & Ownership\\nThe dimension Responsibilities & Ownership dimension entails the following factors: clearly defined roles\\nand responsibilities (Goniwada, 2022; Hokkanen, 2021; Loukiala, Joutsenlahti, Raatikainen, Mikkonen,', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

The dimension Strategy entails therefor the following factors: the existence of clearly\\ndefined objectives (Barham & Daim, 2020; Chanyagorn & Kungwannarongkun, 2011; Hussein et al.,\\n2020), a domain-oriented view on the organization as a whole (Goniwada, 2022; Gouigoux, Tamzalit, &\\nNoppen, 2021; Hokkanen, 2021; Joshi et al., 2021; Loukiala et al., 2021; Ore ˇsˇcanin & Hlupi ´c, 2021), the\\nability to identify current bottlenecks (Al-Ammary & Saleh, 2021; Hazel, n.d.; Hyperight, 2021; Mirarab\\net al., 2014), and an understanding in the degree of coupling between business applications (Goniwada,\\n2022; Hyperight, 2021; Loukiala et al., 2021; Mirarab et al., 2014).\\nGovernance\\nThe dimension Governance entails the following factors: an effective business and IT alignment (Gouigoux\\net al., 2021; Loukiala et al., 2021; I. Machado et al., 2021; Mehmandarov, Waaler, Cameron, Fjellheim, &\\nPettersen, 2021; Mirarab et al., 2014), clear communication guidelines (Goniwada, 2022; Mirarab et al.,\\n2014), an effective data governance (Al-Ammary & Saleh, 2021; Barham & Daim, 2020; Chanyagorn\\n& Kungwannarongkun, 2011; Hussein et al., 2020), and organization-wide standards for maintaining\\ninteroperability between business processes (Al-Ammary & Saleh, 2021; Genovese, 2021; Gouigoux et\\nal., 2021; Henry & Ridene, 2020; I. Machado et al., 2021; Mehmandarov et al., 2021).\\nEnabling Technologies\\nWhile the transition to a Data Mesh architecture is mostly an organizational change, it also includes\\nmany associated technology practices. The dimension Enabling Technologies entails the following factors:\\naccessible and discoverable data assets (Avci Salma et al., 2017; Barham & Daim, 2020; Joshi et al.,\\n2021; Kotorchevikj, 2021; Loukiala et al., 2021; Solano & Jernigan, 2012), and the use of intelligent\\ntooling (Joshi et al., 2021; Mirarab et al., 2014; Priebe et al., 2021).\\nCentral Integration\\nThe cental integration factors relate to the overall business integration processes that enable the inte-\\ngrated functioning of the data architecture of an organization. These factors relate to an organization’s\\ncurrent state of readiness with regards to automated processes and operations that are required to take\\ninto account within a Data Mesh architecture design. The dimension Central Integration entails the\\nfollowing factors: an accessible data catalogue (Avci Salma et al., 2017; Joshi et al., 2021; Kotorchevikj,\\n2021; Solano & Jernigan, 2012), data quality management (Avci Salma et al., 2017; Joshi et al., 2021;\\nMirarab et al., 2014; Priebe et al., 2021), Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)\\nstandards are identified as critical factors for the effective functioning of a distributed data architecture\\n(Genovese, 2021; Gouigoux et al., 2021; Henry & Ridene, 2020; Joshi et al., 2021; Loukiala et al., 2021;\\nI.

PART 2: STRUCTURE OF THE DMRM 25\\nFigure 3.2: Adapted overview of factors influencing Data Mesh readiness\\nThe successful establishment of a Data Mesh architecture depends on an organizations readiness and\\nability to adopt this architecture. Without proper readiness, it is likely that an implementation of a Data\\nMesh architecture will fail (Dang & Pekkola, 2016). Data Mesh readiness refers to an organization’s\\nassessment of how ready and prepared it is to adopt and establish a Data Mesh architecture within the\\ncurrent organizational context. A readiness assessment helps the organization to measure its readiness\\nand identify potential areas for improvement (Jahani, Reza Seyyed Javadein, & Abedi Jafari, 2010).\\nSince the migration to a Data Mesh is not only a technological shift, but rather an organizational shift,\\nits readiness deals with both IT architecture transformation as well as with organizational transforma-\\ntion. Therefore, two kinds of readiness models will be analyzed to design the theoretical DMRM. First,\\nreadiness models that deal with IT architecture transformation and second, readiness models that deal\\nwith organizational transformation.\\n3.2.1 Existing readiness models for IT architecture transformation\\nWhen reviewing scientific literature for existing readiness models that deal with IT architecture- or\\nenterprise architecture transformation, many sources refer to the Business Transformation Readiness\\nAssessment as adopted by The Open Group (TOGAF, 2018). This readiness assessment is build upon\\nthe work by the Canadian Government and its Business Transformation Enablement Program (BTEP)\\n(Weisman, 2004). This assessment determines the Readiness Factor Dimensions that impact the organi-\\nzation when transforming to a new IT architecture. After identification, these readiness factors can be\\nassessed by means of urgency, readiness status and degree of difficulty to fix. Another study conducted\\nby Jahani et al. (2010) propose a method to assess readiness levels for enterprise architecture readiness\\nwithin organizations, based on their own algorithm. However, due to the time constraints of this research\\nproject, this study will not be used as theoretical base for the development of the readiness model. Other\\nIT architecture assessment studies that are provided in literature are merely used for assessing the func-\\ntioning of the architecture, rather than assessing the readiness of an organization to migrate to a new\\narchitecture (Niemi & Ylim ¨aki, 2007; Pruijt, Slot, Plessius, Bos, & Brinkkemper, 2012; van der Raadt,\\nBonnet, Schouten, & van Vliet, 2010; Vasconcelos, Sousa, & Tribolet, 2007; Velitchkov, 2008).\\nTherefore, the TOGAF Business Transformation Readiness Assessment, and foremost its Readiness Factor\\nDimensions, will function as theoretical base for the DMRM.

Their assessment gives a good impression on what readiness factors can\\nbe addressed in order to assess readiness for migrating to a Data Mesh architecture, however, it mostly\\nfocuses on implementation measures than on organizational readiness for change. Moreover, it neglects\\na step-wise approach to assessing whether a Data Mesh is a suitable solution for the organization’s\\nproblem identification, whether the organization is able to migrate to a Data Mesh architecture and\\nwhether it is actually ready for the migration. Since the migration is bound to a socio-technical context,\\nboth technical implementation challenges, as well as the socio- organizational challenges as described\\nbefore need to take into account.\\nIn order to capture the organizational complexity of this migration as well, organizational change mod-\\nels will be taken into account in the next subsection for designing the theoretical DMRM. A visual\\nrepresentation of this design is shown in figure 3.3\\nFigure 3.3: Schematic overview of the design of the theoretical model\\n3.2.3 Existing readiness models for organizational change\\nFirst of all, Buono and Kerber (2009) provide an overview of measures that need to be taken into\\naccount when addressing organizational change. These measures include developing an understanding\\nand acceptance of the proposed change, a willingness and ability to change, building a change-supportive\\ninfrastructure, creating a change-facilitative culture, and ensuring ongoing stategizing. Moreover, they\\nsuggest that when the socio-technical uncertainty of the change is high, that the organizational readiness\\nfor change should be guided. Second, Pellettiere (2006) developed an organization self-assessment to\\ndetermine the readiness for a planned change, by means of assessing an organizations ability to change.\\nThis ability to change has to do with contextual variables such as Vision, Mission, Core Values, and\\nCulture. The results show that an organizations ability to change both gives a strong indication of\\nthe organizations readiness for change. Third, Vakola (2013) define readiness towards organizational\\nchange by means of Willingness to Change, Ability to Change, and Capacity to Change. Moreover,\\nthey draw a distinction between Individual Readiness and Group Readiness. Fourth, Agarwal and Prasad\\n(1997) suggest that organization readiness should be assessed by starting with the Business Value, and\\nsubsequently assessing the current state and the projected future state of the organization. Moreover,\\nOkorie Awa, Ukoha, and Emecheta (2012) argue that the needs and the drivers behind the change should\\nbe assessed in order to assess organization readiness.

First of all, change efforts need to achieve momentum and a\\nsense of urgency. In order to establish this, a need for change has to be defined that touches upon this\\nsense or urgency and problem identification (Smith, 2005). Moreover, the ability to change is seen as\\na prerequisite for entering a state of preparedness and eventually readiness, since this ability is a reflection\\nof the organizations culture and value propositions, in sense of high-level organizational requirements\\nwhich need to be recognized (Waterman Jr, Peters, & Phillips, 1980). Moreover, according to Rosas\\nand Camarinha-Matos (2009), an organization is prepared if a set of preparedness conditions are met.\\nThese conditions are formally defined rules and guidelines that need to be in place in order to be\\nprepared for change. This step has to be taken prior to readiness. Moreover, readiness entails the\\ncomplete set of forces needed to perform the proposed change, by means of organization capabilities\\nand technological functions (Harrison, 2014).\\nA conceptual representation of the various steps to determine organization readiness can be found in\\nfigure 3.4\\n3.2.4 Combining models on IT architecture transformation and organizational change\\nBased on the studies above, a first version of the DMRM has been developed. Due to the strong organi-\\nzational and cultural nature of the migration to a Data Mesh architecture, a step-wise approach of first\\nassessing the need, second assessing high-level contextual ability to migrate, third assessing formal pre-\\nparedness for migration and lastly determining actual readiness is adopted.

PART 3: REFINEMENT OF THE DMRM 30\\n3.3 part 3: refinement of the dmrm\\nIn this part, the theoretical model as designed in the previous parts is refined on the basis of several\\nsubject-matter expert refinement sessions. Because the theoretical model was build up on many different\\nsources of information (e.g. existing studies on readiness, exploratory interviews, existing studies on\\norganizational change and existing studies on technology readiness), it was decided to make an extra\\niteration in the design and development of the model before it is demonstrated in practice. This design\\niteration is performed based on practical experience of the participants of this research step, so that the\\nmodel is both theoretically and empirically founded before it is used in the next steps of the research.\\nFirst, the theoretical Data Mesh model is refined on the basis of refinement sessions with four different\\nsubject-matter experts. Subsequently, a refinement evaluation session was organized in which the refined\\nmodel is evaluated on the basis of the suggested additions during the interviews. The practical value\\nthat is gained during this empirical research step helps to make the theoretical model more generically\\napplicable for organizations in a practical context. This section ends with a refined version of the DMRM\\nto be used for the following steps in this research.\\n3.3.1 Subject-Matter Expert Sessions\\nIn order to refine the theoretical model, a number of subject-matter expert sessions are organized. These\\npeople are able to test the functioning and completeness of the model against their own experiences with\\nassessing readiness for Data Mesh migrations, and are thus able to refine the model as a whole. In order\\nto mitigate risk for bias, experts both from Deloitte as well as from external businesses and organizations\\nwere asked to join these sessions.\\nInterview 1: Subject-matter expert 1 (Deloitte - Data Mesh analyst)\\nDuring the first refinement session, the DMRM was walked through and provided with feedback. The\\nsubject-matter expert suggested to bring back the original factor dimensions into high-level People,\\nProcess and Technology categorization in order to give extra contextual clarity to the factors that are\\nassessed in the model. Moreover, he suggested to think of a scoring mechanism when designing the\\nReadiness Assessment Instrument, in order to indicate what dimensions the assessed organizations need\\nto work on for future improvement.\\nInterview 2: Subject-matter expert 2 (Extern - Principal Engineer)\\nDuring the second refinement session, the interviewee mentioned that for them the lack of data engineers\\nis not a real problem. Instead, they lack a coherent data strategy which results in the fact that a lot\\nof data engineers are doing redundant work. This is a result of an alignment problem, more than it is\\na problem with the availability of data engineers. As a result, the interviewee stated that the list of\\nNeeds for a Data Mesh architecture could be expanded with an insufficient data strategy . Moreover, the\\ninterviewee addressed the importance of continuous delivery in an organization as a way to address the\\ngap between data engineers and data analysts. Moreover, the interviewee emphasized the importance\\nof painting the picture of organizational chaos as a means for assessing its ability to change. Lastly, the\\ninterviewee stated that the insufficient availability of data engineers should be rephrased to a need for\\nreduced cognitie load of data engineering teams , in order ease the interpretation of the factor. Lastly,\\nthe interviewee stated that the lack of domain knowledge for data engineers that are positioned in new\\ndomains is automatically disentangled by putting the people together in a domain team and involving\\nthem in the normal domain operations.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",

PART 3: REFINEMENT OF THE DMRM 31\\nInterview 3: Subject-matter expert 3 (Extern - Co-founder & Senior Consultant)\\nDuring the third refinement session, the major topic of discussion was the part of the model that guides\\nassessing the need of organizations to migrate to a Data Mesh. Firstly, the interviewee stated that the\\nneed is not really covered by an insufficient availability of data engineers . This interviewee stated that\\nfor some organizations, these data engineers are available, but they do not adhere to an overarching\\ndata strategy . To some extend, this aligns with the statements of subject-matter expert 2 in subsection\\n3.3.1. He suggested to focus more on the addressing of the data platform bottleneck, than on the\\navailability of data engineers. Moreover, this interviewee identified long lead times between stating a\\nrequest to data operations and the data analysts receiving the results as an important driver behind an\\norganization’s need for a Data Mesh. This lead time is a specific example of the data platform bottleneck.\\nLastly, this interviewee identified an alignment of the team structures within the organizations with the\\nbusiness domains as an important prerequisite for an organization’s readiness towards a distributed\\narchitecture.\\nInterview 4: Subject-matter expert 4 (Extern - Data Strategist)\\nSubject-matter expert 4 was interviewed during the fourth refinement session. First, the interviewee\\nsuggested that Assessing the need should be more centered on Return on Investment andData Products .\\nMoreover, the interviewee clarified that when talking about the need for flexibility and the need for\\nscalability , these needs should be further defined by a lack of architectural flexibility to handle lots of\\nuse cases and a lack of architectural scalability when these platforms become very expensive to run.\\nThe interviewee therefore suggested to rephrase these factors to a need for greater flexibility of the data\\nplatform and a need for greater scalability of the data platform , in order to improve interpretability of the\\nfactors. Moreover, he proposed an understanding in the identifiable domains could be rephrased to the\\nability to decentralize , as that would also clarify the interpretation of the factor. Lastly, the interviewee\\naddressed that factors concerning employee skills should be added to the model, as the migration to a\\nData Mesh requires learning a lot of new and improved skills.\\n3.3.2 Refinement Evaluation Group-Panel\\nIn order to evaluate on the refinements resulting from the above described sessions, as well as to further\\nimprove the model, an intermediate evaluation session was organized to discuss the refinements as made\\nso far. This session was attended by 26 Data Mesh subject-matter experts from Deloitte Denmark.\\nThe evaluation session started with a general introduction to the topic of Data Mesh. Additionally, this\\nresearch was elaborated on, as well as the DMRM and the exploratory interviews that have led to it.Lastly,\\nthe adaptations to the DMRM as suggested during the refinement sessions were discussed.\\n•The panel stated the importance of creating the domain teams and defining their boundaries. It\\nwas identified during the session that aligning domains together with the business structure is not\\nalways possible, especially not when there are teams that cross business domains. Examples of these\\nteams could be teams maintaining ERP source systems or subsystem domain teams. Therefore,\\nwhen decentralizing a formerly monolithic architecture, it was agreed on to structure the domain\\nteams in line with the business structure as suggested by subject-matter expert 3, unless the system\\noriented teams are not forgotten in this approach.\\n•The importance employee skills and knowledge sharing opportunities, as suggested by subject-\\nmatter expert 4 was agreed upon. A way to establish this factor in practice could be for example\\nby incorporating a knowledge sharing platform within the organization.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 41}),\n",

CHAPTER CONCLUSION 32\\n•The panel agreed upon the addition of the need for shorter lead times to the model, since they\\nidentified this need as one of the major drivers behind the desire to migrate to a Data Mesh\\narchitecture.\\n•The importance of CI/CD standards and automation standards was evaluated. The panel stated\\nthat these standards are not per se required, but would really be a nice to have feature within\\na Data mesh architecture. Especially with respect to shorter lead times, it would be important\\nto include automation standards within your organization, since this automation would be key to\\nliberate the resources within domains while scaling, instead of enlarging the maintenance efforts.\\n3.3.3 Refinements to the DMRM\\nTable 3.5 shows the refinements resulting from the refinement sessions and the evaluation session in this\\nchapter.\\nTable 3.5: Results of the refinement sessions\\nRefinement Source\\nAdd the factor to the model:\\n[Team structures aligned with business structure]\\nin the Assess the preparedness for change phaseRefinement session 3\\nAdd the factor to the model:\\n[Knowledge sharing platform]\\nin the Assess the preparedness for change phaseRefinement session 4\\nAdd the factor to the model:\\n[The need for shorter lead times]\\nin the Assess the reason to change phaseRefinement evaluation\\nsession\\nChange the importance of the factor:\\n[CI/CD standards]\\ntoNice to haveRefinement evaluation\\nsession\\nChange the importance of the factor:\\n[Automation standards]\\ntoNice to haveRefinement evaluation\\nsession\\n3.4 chapter conclusion\\nIn this chapter, the DMRM is designed. The design process of the model was build up in three parts,\\nstructured by the corresponding sub-questions.\\nThe first part aimed to answer sub-question 2: What are the factors that influence readiness for migrating\\nto a Data Mesh architecture? . By reviewing existing literature and conducting exploratory interviews, a\\nconceptual framework was developed containing influencing factors on Data Mesh readiness.\\nThe second part aimed to answer sub-question 3: Which readiness assessments with regard to IT ar-\\nchitecture transformation are provided in literature? . After reviewing literature, a list of existing studies\\nwas extracted on technology readiness assessments. These studies formed the base of the structure of\\nthe DMRM. Since the analysis within this research shows that Data Mesh readiness emerges from both\\nthe technological dimension of the organization, as well as from the organizational side, the DMRM has\\nbeen designed upon a combination of technology readiness models and organizational change models.\\nThe two-dimensional structure of the DMRM ensures that both the organizational side of the migration', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 42}),\n",

Finalizing, the factors as identified\\nin the first part were mapped onto their corresponding organizational readiness-step in the DMRM. Con-\\nsequently, a first version of the DMRM emerged, as shown in figure 3.7. This model is used to formulate\\nan initial answer to sub-question 4: How would a model look like for organizations which want to assess\\ntheir readiness for migration to a Data Mesh architecture? .\\nThe third part of the model design process consisted of model refinement activities, in order to evaluate\\nthe outcomes of the former parts and to gain a stronger empirical foundation for the design decisions.\\nThe refinements were made based on the insights from several refinement sessions and the consensus\\nfrom one group-session. Overall, the refinement activity in this research serves as additional iteration\\nstep on the previous version of the DMRM.

First, the structure of the DMRM will be elaborated on, providing\\nthe purpose of and an explanation on its two-dimensional design. Second, the factors within the DMRM\\nare described in detail. The follow-up questions that are formulated for every factor initially serve as\\nsupport for the definition of the factors. Moreover, during the upcoming testing activity, they serve as\\nguideline for the self-assessment function of the DMRM. Finally, attention is paid on the way in which\\nthe model can be used. This section explains the purpose and functioning of the model.\\n4.1 description of the structure of the dmrm\\nThe DMRM is structured onto two dimensions: on the horizontal axis the DMRM is build up in several\\norganizational steps towards Data Mesh readiness, and on the vertical axis the DMRM consists of\\nseveral factor dimensions influencing the particular readiness steps.\\nDue to the complex nature of a Data Mesh architecture in both organizational and technological areas,\\nthe design of the model provides structure in the long-term migration process of organizations towards\\nData Mesh readiness.\\nIn addition, because it became apparent during the formulation of the knowledge gap that it is not\\nalways clear to organizations whether a Data Mesh addresses their respective needs, the first step of the\\nDMRM consists of problem identification that must be completed before the process is started. If this\\nproblem identification shows that a Data Mesh architecture does not sufficiently address their needs, it\\nis not necessary for the organization to resume the next assessment.\\nThe final step of the DMRM covers the overall technological and organizational readiness for a Data\\nMesh architecture, based on the structural principles of the Data Mesh concept. A remark that should\\nbe made here is that it is not necessary for all organizations to implement every specific principle in\\ndetail: going through the DMRM will show which parts of the organization need more attention than\\nother parts.\\n4.2 description of the factors in the dmrm\\nThis section describes the factors from the Data Mesh Readiness Model.

It therefore allows for organizational\\nlearning, aiming to facilitate faster decision-making regarding the presented improvement-areas of the\\nparticipating organization. When using the DMRM, it could be beneficial for organizations to choose\\na group of diverse participants with different roles within the organization. Due to the broad scoping\\nof the model, ranging from strategical and organization-wide dimensions to operational and technology\\nimplementation dimensions, readiness for a Data Mesh architecture could be assessed within all these\\ndifferent layers of the organization.\\nDue to the process and lengthy nature of a Data Mesh migration, it is recommended to use the assessment\\nas a guideline throughout the entire process. Since it is unrealistic to assume that a Data Mesh migration\\ncan be completed within one iteration step, the step-by-step assessment model can be used to assess\\nthe progression of the different steps. It is also possible to use the assessment in later readiness steps\\nto assess earlier steps, to improve or distort implementations that have already been done. In other\\nwords, it is recommended to take the assessment repeatedly during the Data Mesh migration process.\\nIn this way, the as-is state of the organization and the aspired to-be state can be assessed frequently\\nand in a structured manner, so that the ambition levels that the organization is seeking to achieve can\\nbe determined time and again. In this way, after each assessment, the gap between the as-is state and\\nthe desired state of the organization can be analyzed, on the basis of which an improvement path can\\nbe formulated.\\nThe DMRM should primarily be seen as an organizational guideline for structuring and organizing a\\nmulti-dimensional Data Mesh migration, rather than as a quantifiable assessment tool. The reason for\\nthis is twofold. First, a Data Mesh migration often depends on the specific organization in which it is\\nperformed, and it is therefore difficult to give a standardized quantitative rating to the degree of factors\\npresent. Secondly, it is beyond the aim of the assessment to present a one-off rating: after all, this\\nnumber does not provide sufficient insight into the independent improvement areas and could lead to\\nthe risk of overseeing specific organizational challenges.\\nIn order to strengthen the value of the DMRM, a set of standardized recommendations is required to\\ngenerate an advice based on the outcome of the assessment. These standardized recommendations are\\ndetermined based gathering best-practice approaches from participating participants in this study. The\\nconsensus that can be created on the basis of these best practices will be presented at the end of this\\nresearch, after gathering all the necessary empirical data. These best-practice recommendations can\\nbe used by the users of the assessment to shape their improvement path in a specific sense. The set\\nof recommendations for the assessment users, as gathered throughout this research, can be found in\\nAppendix A.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",

The conduction of the demonstrations is designed as a multiple-\\ncase study design, whose design and case-study design decisions are elaborated on in the beginning of\\nthis chapter. Subsequently, all demonstrations are presented independently of each other, after which\\nthe results of the demonstrations are presented in an overarching overview. Moreover, the comments,\\nopinions and insights of the participants will be presented as additional findings. These comments are\\npresented in italics between quotation marks. This chapter ends with an analysis on the complete set\\nof demonstrations, in order to draw conclusions on both the performance of the DMRM within specific\\ncontexts, as well as the contextual influence on Data Mesh readiness.\\n5.1 demonstration method\\nThe demonstrations of the DMRM in practice will be set up as a single-participant multiple-case study.\\nFirst, the decision to choose a case study design will be elaborated on, and second, the decision for a\\nsingle-participant design will be explained.\\n5.1.1 Case Study Design\\nA case study approach is chosen, since this method supports the development of the implementation\\nmodel by assessing the practical value of a theoretical model. This practical value helps to make the\\ngeneric theoretical model specific for Data Mesh readiness assessments. Moreover, case studies are rele-\\nvant when there are exploratory grounds within the research topic where existing contemporary theories\\nare not applicable (Flyvbjerg, 2006). Considering that this research is about a new organization of the\\ndata architecture design of organizations, there is a new topic that is still fully under development. This\\nconcerns a contemporary phenomenon, a research area in which, according to Yin (2017), it is customary\\nand relevant to choose a case study research design.\\nAdditionally, this research was carried out as part of the graduation within the CoSEM master’s program.\\nTypical research topics within CoSEM look for the possibility of designing a solution within a technolog-\\nically and organizationally complex context. A case study is suitable for such an investigation because\\nit leaves room for building a new theory by building on its application in practice.\\nDuring this research, case studies were conducted by collecting data through interviews and documents\\nfrom various cases. Since data is collected from multiple sources in a multiple case-study design, the\\nconclusions that can be drawn up from the study allow for the extension of the existing knowledge base\\non Data Mesh readiness (Yin, 2017). The model as designed in the previous chapters in this report will\\nbe demonstrated among these cases, in order to evaluate and iterate on the design of the model based\\non the collected data. In order to assure consistency among the interviews, a case study protocol was\\ndefined and followed. This case-study protocol can be found in Appendix E.\\n40', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

DEMONSTRATION METHOD 41\\n5.1.2 Single-Participant Case Study Design\\nThe strategic selection of cases enhances the quality of case studies (Flyvbjerg, 2006). For most of the\\ncases within this research, the case study was conducted with a single participant. The reason for this\\ndesign decision lies within the fact that the the purpose of these case studies is not primarily to create\\ngeneralizable conclusions, but rather to collect as many different attitudes towards the topic and perform\\na cross-analysis on these attitudes. Therefore, the case study results are likely to be limited in terms of\\ngenerelizability, but offer a contribution in terms adding knowledge accumulation on Data Mesh concepts\\nin a descriptive and phenomenological way (Flyvbjerg, 2006). Based on the aforementioned purpose, it\\nwas decided to extend the case study design through the conduction of interviews among a greater\\namount of different organizations and context, rather than a greater amount of internal perspectives\\nwithin the participating organizations.\\n5.1.3 Case Selection\\nIn order to strategically select cases for this research, several requirements for the case studies have been\\ndefined. These requirements are:\\n•Size : Since the complexity of migrating to a Data Mesh lies partly in the organizational challenges\\nthat it entails, organizations that are selected for the case study should have over 1,000 employees\\n•Experience : In order to be able to assess readiness for a Data Mesh architecture, it is required\\nthat the organization has some experience with implementing a Data Mesh, or else with gather-\\ning the background knowledge about Data Mesh architectures. Using the readiness assessment\\nrequires at least a basic knowledge of the concepts and the functioning of Data Mesh architectures.\\nOrganizations that have no conceptual understanding about Data Mesh architectures are less able\\nto assess their own capabilities with respect to readiness for it.\\n•Implementation : In order to address the entire scope of implementation levels, the case selection\\nshould entail a variety in current Data Mesh implementation levels. In order words, the organiza-\\ntions that are selected must vary in the stage of Data Mesh implementation they’re at currently,\\nvarying from not having started the implementation up until having finalized a complete Data\\nMesh implementation.\\n•Role : The availability of interviewees affects the possibility of conducting an interview at an\\norganization. Selecting an interviewee within a particular organization is done based on the role\\nthey have within the organization. Due to the technological and data-related characteristics of\\nData Mesh architectures, interviewees that have common knowledge of the current state of the\\ndata architecture of the organization are selected.\\nAccording to Yin (2017), each case must be carefully selected so that the individual case either predict\\nsimilar results or predict contrasting results but for anticipated reasons. For this case study, organizations\\nwere selected from different industries.\\nBased on the requirements, six companies have been selected for the case study that fulfill all require-\\nments. In this thesis, they are referred to as Organization N, Organization O, Organization P, Organi-\\nzation Q, Organization R, Organization S and Organization T.

By means of enhancing the construct validity of this research, the conducted\\ninterviews were transcribed and coded in order to be able to draw ex-post conclusions. These verbatim\\ninterviews allow for the cross-case analysis of particular quotations and specific perspectives among\\nparticipants, in order to enhance the quality of the empirical base of evidence (Griggs, 1987). Moreover,\\nmultiple sources of evidence were gathered throughout the process, since the case studies were conducted\\namong many different contexts based on the selection criteria (Riege, 2003).\\nInternal validity ensures that the conclusions that were drawn up from the obtained data are adequate\\n(Ferreira et al., 2020). The internal validity of this research was enhanced by discussing the case results\\nwith the participants after the interviews in order to check for this adequacy. Moreover, the results\\namong all cases were cross-checked after the conduction of all case studies in order to assure internal\\ncoherence of all findings (Yin, 1994).\\nExternal validity ensures that the accumulated findings from the case studies can be used for the\\nrepresentation of the studied phenomenon as a whole (Ferreira et al., 2020). This external validity has\\nbeen improved by comparing the findings of the case studies with the other findings as found earlier in\\nthe study. In this way, the results of the case studies can be used to strengthen the overall scientific and\\nempirical contribution to the body of knowledge within the stated scope of the study (Klein & Myers,\\n1999).\\nLastly, reliability deals with the probability that another researcher would arrive at similar results with\\nthe same research (Ferreira et al., 2020). The reliability of this research is enhanced in two ways. First,\\na set-up of semi-structured interviews guided by an established case study protocol was used (Yin, 1994).\\nSecond, the case study interviews were recorded during their execution, which also contributes to the\\nreliability of the study (Nair & Riege, 1995).\\n5.1.5 Analysis of the Case Studies\\nAfter conducting all case studies in this research, the collected data is analyzed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS 43\\nFirst, all participants were asked general questions to get an idea of their experience with Data Mesh\\nconcepts and their organizations’ current level of implementation. After these questions, the research\\nmodel was presented to the participants, so that the structure of the model and the factor dimensions\\ncould be seen. First, the participant was asked whether the model and readiness steps seemed correct\\nand complete. Then all factors in the model were run through. For each factor, it was assessed whether\\nthe factor was already applied in the organization and what the perceived importance of this factor was.\\nThe reason for these indications was also noted. Finally, the participant had the opportunity to share\\ncomments about the model with the researcher.\\nSecondly, the case study reports and assessment results of the participants were elaborated and compared\\nwith each other, so that the similarities and differences under the existing perspectives can be found.\\nThis led to a summarized overview of all results gathered during the interviews.\\nThirdly, this overview was analysed. Because the results also included the perceived degree of importance\\nof all participants, as well as the level of practical implications of these factors, this overview contained\\nseveral insights and perspectives. The interesting or contributing insights and perspectives are then\\nprocessed as an exact quote in the research report.\\n5.2 description of the demonstrations\\nThis section presents the conducted case studies, by means of a detailed description of the DMRM\\ndemonstration within that particular case. The cases are described by their industry sector, their number\\nof employees, and their Data Mesh experience. The last term distinguishes cases based on whether\\nor not they have experience in setting up a migration path towards a Data Mesh architecture in the\\norganization.\\n5.2.1 Case 1: Interviewee N\\nInformation Technology — 1,500 employees — Data Mesh experience\\nAssessing the need for a Data Mesh\\nThe need for a Data Mesh arose from the fact that there were technical and organizational issues within\\nthe organization that needed to be resolved. There was a challenge that multiple domains existed\\nwithin the organization, but they were all struggling because they had different definitions of the term\\n’person’ . This resulted in the fact that the domains were unable to work interoperably with each other’s\\ndata. From a technical perspective, one would define a person as a customer, while the other would\\ndefine a person as an individual. These definitions differed across the domains, so it was unclear in\\nthe interaction between different systems. In addition, they had also been a company that had grown\\nthrough acquisition and had several disparate groups that had implemented things independently for a\\nlong time. So they all had individual silos that could hardly cross-collaborate with each other. They had\\na central data team that became a major bottleneck in this situation, not necessarily from a technical\\nperspective, but especially from an organizational perspective that team became a blocker to getting\\nthings done. The central data team had more organizational power than they should have, which meant\\nthat decision-making fell short.\\nAssessing the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nOne of the most important factors of this phase was the ability to think about data as products, not\\nprojects. If this ability does not exist, there is no point in migrating to a Data Mesh. This organization', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS 44\\nalready had strong product thinking about data, which made that mental leap very straightforward. As\\na result, only some technical training was required for the current product owners. In addition, the\\nability to decentralize the current monolithic organization was very decisive here. This organization\\nalready thought in terms of domains, because they maintained a domain map of their organization. This\\nmap helped them to set boundaries in terms of ownership, responsibility, and the groundwork for what\\nindividual teams do decide on and what they do not decide on, so that the different domains would\\nnot step on each other’s toes. In addition, the influence of top management engagement has greatly\\ninfluenced this organization. The project came to a standstill for a while when a new CTO was hired\\nwho was not supportive of the migration, due to different motivations and directions. As a result, they\\ncame to a standstill in the early implementation phase. A final factor that was important within this\\norganization, but which is not reflected in the model, is the scale of the organization. Some organizations\\nare simply too small for a Data Mesh, and would be better suited by sticking with a monolithic model.\\nOnly when the complexity of the problem the organization is trying to solve becomes too great for a\\nmonolith, it makes sense to think about a Data Mesh.\\nAssessing the preparedness to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nAs for the preparedness of this organization, they had a lot to do with setting up standards and guidelines.\\nEspecially since it was often forgotten that when changes are made upstream, sometimes downstream\\nand cross-domain use cases can be broken. With regard to the preparedness for a Data Mesh, it was\\nvery important for this organization to set up standards and guidelines that structured this. One of the\\nexamples of this was the CI/CD standards as a mechanism to do this. In addition, the data product\\npublication standards have proven to be very important in the sense of not only having an API for the\\nstructure of the data, but also about how the data product itself may evolve over time. It turned out to\\nbe important to model that in the contract of the data product itself, so that the data product becomes\\ntrustworthy for other domains to use.\\nDetermining the readiness for a Data Mesh\\nAs for the complete set of Data Mesh building blocks, this has not yet been fully implemented in the\\norganization. The reason for this is mainly that it is still very chaotic from an organizational point of\\nview and the governance is not yet fully aligned across the various domains. A step in the right direction\\nhas proved to be not to keep the federalized governance model completely federalized, but to continue to\\nhave a centralized governance team that can enforce the new rules and guidelines across the organization\\nas a whole. Finally, it has become apparent within this organization that a Data Mesh can certainly\\naddress as number of their needs, especially with respect to their organizational challenges, but that its\\nimplementation is a lengthy process.\\n5.2.2 Case 2: Interviewee O\\nPublic Services — 7,000 employees — Data Mesh experience\\nAssessing the need for Data Mesh\\nThe need for a Data Mesh architecture for this organization was mainly due to the excessive independence\\nof the various data-generating domains. The domains worked too independently of each other, and there\\nwas no awareness about how to prepare own data for use by other domains. This was mainly due to\\nthe fact that they did not think in the context of processes, but mainly continued to think in their own\\nbusiness domain. The groups within the organization did not talk to each other, nor did they think\\nabout the consumers of their own data. As a result, the consumers of the data were too dependent on\\nthe source domains and therefore not autonomous enough.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS 45\\nAssessing the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nThe ability to migrate to a Data Mesh at this organization came from a correct business and IT alignment.\\nThese two were initially not aligned, in the sense that the business was not aware of the data required\\nfor certain objectives, and the data teams did not know what business value was in their data. It took a\\nwhile before there was a realization within this organization that consensus about the data was needed\\nto extract more value from the operations. They therefore started mandating more data awareness and\\ndata literacy across the entire organization, so that everyone understood the basic principles of data. In\\naddition, the ability to migrate also turned out to lie to a large extent in enabling the domain-people to\\nbecome more data aware, in order to avoid the problem of having too few data engineers. In addition,\\ndecentralizing the organization was a big task. Because it proved difficult to find the right level of\\nabstraction from a business perspective, it turned out to be more important to think from service design\\nand processes than from purely business oriented domains. Finally, the top management engagement\\nwithin this organization played a major role, as they were very engaged with the migration from the start\\nand therefore provided the resources to make it happen.\\nAssessing the preparedness to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nThe preparedness for a Data Mesh for this organization came mainly from the construction of a data\\ninfrastructure that made it easy for data engineers to make a good product for their consumers. Prepared-\\nness was therefore not necessarily measured by implementing the correct CI/CD standards or automation\\nguidelines, but more by mapping out the ideas of a more consumer-oriented way of producing data. There\\nwas a fear within this organization that if too many technical standards and operations were implemented\\ntoo quickly, it would deter the necessary way of working within a Data Mesh. That is why they started\\nsmall and only implemented the necessary infrastructure and thinking that brought them in the direction\\nof the Data Mesh way of working.\\nDetermining the readiness for a Data Mesh\\nAlmost an entire Data Mesh has been implemented within this organization. It turned out to be an\\niterative and time-consuming process, which had to be approached in a very structured and precise\\nmanner. In addition, there are still ongoing measurements of certain KPIs such as data quality checks\\nand other efficiency measurements, to determine whether the new data architecture meets the objectives\\nand needs. Within this organization it turned out to be important to consider the influencing factors for\\nthe migration to a Data Mesh at different importance levels, so that not all prerequisites had to be in\\nplace in order to be able to get started.\\n5.2.3 Case 3: Interviewee P\\nFinancial Services — 20,000 employees — Data Mesh experience\\nAssessing the need for Data Mesh\\nThe biggest need this organization had was to improve the quality and trustworthiness of the data.\\nIN addition, the organization had to deal with a large overload of the data engineering teams. As a\\nresult, these overloaded teams gained a motivation to migrate to a Data Mesh architecture. Finally,\\nthere was a desire to become more data-driven, which also brought the business teams on board for the\\nchange.\\nAssessing the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nWith regard to the ability to change, it was important for this organization to formulate clear objectives\\nthat matched the needs of the organization. This helped with getting the rest of the organization on', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",

In line with this, they worked on a clear value statement and a Data Mesh Proof of Concept, with\\nwhich they could prove the value of the Data Mesh architecture. With this proof of concept it turned\\nout to be important not only to focus on the technology, but especially on the organizational shift that\\nwould come with it. Finally, the existence of a learning culture was of crucial value. The organization\\nhas given the people time to learn and evolve over a longer and iterative period.\\nAssessing the preparedness to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nWith regard to preparedness, this organization attached great importance to designing a suitable gover-\\nnance model. In this, they strongly believed in the power of automation to make tasks easier for the\\ndomains, but also for the central governance team. It also turned out to be important to think carefully\\nabout the way in which you set up the domain teams, so that the responsibilities are correctly distributed.\\nExample roles included a data owner on the business side, data custodian on the engineering side, and\\na data steward in the middle, with the data steward acting as the one who understands the data, but\\nalso acting as a liaison outside the domain.\\nDetermining the readiness for a Data Mesh\\nOne of the key components of the Data Mesh within this organization was the self-serve platform. This\\nplatform should serve the majority of the organization in a proper way, and therefore would initially be\\nbuilt very generically to be able to be used by the majority of users within the organization. The platform\\nshould also provide good guidance on transforming and automating the data and its processing, so that\\nconfiguration within the domains could be made easier. The performance indicators of this platform were\\nmainly within an acceleration of the deployment of data services. Finally, the aim of the platform was to\\ngain a better picture of who consumes data, and why, through data virtualization and federation.\\n5.2.4 Case 4: Interviewee Q1 & Interviewee Q2\\nInformation Technology — 1,000 employees — Data Mesh consultants\\nAssessing the need for Data Mesh\\nOrganizations that are guided by this interviewee often have to deal with a large number of domains with\\na lot of complexity, which causes problems with regard to the scalability of the organization. In addition,\\nduring problem identification, there is often a great need to become more data-driven, so that decisions\\ncan be based on data. It also emerged from the case study that it is not always about assessing the\\nspecific needs of a company during problem identification, but that the value that organizations want to\\nget from a Data Mesh often also plays a major role in this. According to this interviewee, the desire to\\nenable decision-making on the basis of data is the main motivation.\\nAssessing the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nFirst, it was important for these organizations that the value that the Data Mesh will bring is clear and\\nunderstandable for everyone at all levels of the organization. This made it possible to introduce the\\ndata-driven culture top-down. This interviewee also indicated that the importance of proper education\\nwithin organizations is very important. Finally, it has been found that organizations that have already\\ngone through a major data-driven migration, such as a cloud transition or a DevOps transition, are in\\na better position compared to data mesh migration than organizations that have not yet experienced\\nit.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS 47\\nAssessing the preparedness to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nWhen the preparedness for a Data Mesh migration is assessed within organizations, it is important\\nthat the new roles and responsibilities become apparent, according to this interviewee. This was done\\nby setting up global contracts defining these responsibilities. The priorities were laid down therein in\\nconsultation with the domains, so that everyone was aware of them. The bounded context concepts, such\\nas those derived from previous distributed architecture designs, were strongly taken into account.\\nDetermining the readiness for a Data Mesh\\nThis case study has shown that there is a difference between assessing readiness for an organization and\\npreparing the organization for a Data Mesh architecture. Readiness mainly has to do with meeting the\\nright organizational and cultural requirements that make such a migration possible, where the preparation\\ngoes more into a migration to a Data Mesh specifically. Where these two pillars can be combined in one\\nmodel as is done in this study, it is important to clarify prior to the assessment what Data Mesh-specific\\nknowledge of the assessor is required to be able to assess the concepts. In addition, it is important to know\\nwhat stage they are in with regard to Data Mesh migration of the organization being assessed.\\n5.2.5 Case 5: Interviewee R1 & Interviewee R2\\nTechnology Consulting — 4,000 employees — Data Mesh consultants\\nAssessing the need for Data Mesh\\nThe organization that was guided by this interviewee mainly had to deal with domain teams that were not\\nindependent enough. As a result, a need arose for a new way of data sharing that puts the responsibility\\nin the domains themselves, so that they could perform their own analyses on their own data. Until\\nnow, this responsibility mainly rested with the central data team. In addition, there was a need for the\\nability to have a platform infrastructure that was customized to their own needs. Finally, there was\\na very centralized data strategy, which was actually good. The domains needed to define their own\\ndata strategy, but they still have to adhere to the central strategy of the organization. Finally, the\\ndata engineering teams lacked business context. For example, they were tasked with performing data\\ntransformations for the domain teams, but they had no idea what would happen to that output.\\nAssessing the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nWith regard to the desire to transition, at the organization in question this mainly came from the\\ndomains. This also turned out to be important, because these domains also have to take responsibility\\nfor the data. In addition, it turned out that there were too few skills within some domains to create\\nand maintain data products. It was therefore very important that there was an overarching learning\\nculture, in which there was room for upskilling certain people in the domains. This upskilling has proven\\nto be important when making the transition to the Data Mesh. In addition, it was difficult to make\\na clear value statement within this organization. In terms of returns on investment, it proved difficult\\nto monetize the performance of the Data Mesh. Therefore, an attempt has been made to express it in\\nthe downward trend in lead times, and the speed at which data products were generated. Because the\\ndrive within the organization was to become more data-driven, these returns on investment were more\\nimportant than the monetary values that come out of it. Finally, in terms of the decentralization process,\\nmany of the domains already existed. However, the problem was that these domains lacked autonomy\\nfrom an IT perspective, so these domains also needed the resources to hire people who had the necessary\\nskill set. had. It turned out to be important to see per domain whether they had the autonomy for a\\nData Mesh from an IT perspective.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS 48\\nAssessing the preparedness to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nThe next phase of the migration to a Data Mesh was mainly characterized in this organization by defining\\nthe new roles and responsibilities within the organization and the domains specific. In addition, it has\\nalso proved important to properly define the responsibility of the central platform team, because it has\\nto provide certain components of the Data Mesh to the domains. Within the domains there must be\\nclear responsibilities, such as that of a data product owner. In addition, there had to be clear ownership\\nof the data products that the domains publish, in order to make cross-domain collaboration possible.\\nWith regard to governance, it turned out that this federalized governance model has to be built on the\\norganization in question. It is important to enforce certain components, such as the privacy and security\\nof data products, from a central team. The way in which the domains themselves came to their data\\nproducts and how they collaborated was left to the domains themselves to regulate. It turned out to be\\na challenge, from a technical perspective, to deliver the components of the infrastructure to the different\\nteams so that they could actually adhere to the central policies.\\nDetermining the readiness for a Data Mesh\\nThis case study has shown that it can be important for organizations preparing themselves for a Data\\nMesh migration to ensure the required skills among its employees. These skills can be improved by\\na well-established learning culture. Moreover, it turned out to be of positive influence on Data Mesh\\nreadiness to organize the specific roles and responsibilities within the future domain teams in a structured\\nmanner.\\n5.2.6 Case 6: Interviewee S\\nInformation Technology — 1,000 employees — No Data Mesh experience\\nAssessing the need for Data Mesh\\nThe organization in this case study had no experience with implementing a Data Mesh architecture.\\nDuring the assessments of a need for a Data Mesh architecture, it emerged that an organization must\\nhave a lot of experience with processing and using data to be able to see the added value of a Data\\nMesh. In addition, this interviewee found it difficult to determine the essential difference between Data\\nMesh architectures and other distributed architectures. The interviewee could imagine that there is a\\ndesire to become a data-driven organization and that this can be filled with, for example, a migration to\\na Data Mesh architecture.\\nAssessing the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nAs for the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh architecture, this interviewee mainly foresaw problems with\\nsplitting the monolith into decentralized domains. In addition, with regard to the decoupling of existing\\napplications, an issue arose around the connection of application with the Data Mesh architecture. The\\ninterviewee stated that a sophisticated and mature data virtualization solution should be implemented\\nthat can ensure that data can be shared across the different domains without the need to copy the data.\\nFinally, this interviewee emphasized the importance of education and training to introduce the new way\\nof working across the organization as a whole.\\nAssessing the preparedness to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nBecause this organization had absolutely no experience with implementing Data Mesh solutions, assessing\\nthe preparedness for a Data Mesh turned out to be premature. The interviewee agreed upon the factors as\\nreflected in the model, although doubts were raised about the federalized governance model. According\\nto the interviewee, this model would only be possible within the organization if there was also a central', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 58}),\n",

In\\naddition, this interviewee foresaw that CI/CD solutions and degrees of automation were not necessary\\nfor performing a Data Mesh, but could be better identified as extra features that would make the way\\nof working more efficient.\\nDetermining the readiness for a Data Mesh\\nWith regard to determining the readiness for a Data Mesh architecture, this organization was still at\\nan early stage. It has become clear from this case study that with organizations at such an early, or\\nperhaps even non-existent, stage it is difficult to go through the entire chain of readiness steps as shown\\nin the model. It would therefore be better according to this case study to use the model iteratively\\nduring the process, in order to identify areas for improvement and to gain insights about the progression\\nof the migration. Because migrating to a Data Mesh architecture mainly requires organizational efforts\\nand is therefore a long-term project, an iterative use of the readiness model could provide structure and\\nguidance during this process.\\n5.2.7 Case 7: Interviewee T\\nLogistics — 7,500 employees — Data Mesh experience\\nAssessing the need for Data Mesh\\nWithin this organization there were two main needs that led to the implementation of a Data Mesh\\narchitecture. Firstly, there was too little ownership and understanding of their data. It was unclear what\\nthe data meant and how engineers and analysts could collect certain data. As a result, there was little\\nconfidence in the data. Secondly, it was difficult to make changes to the existing data platform. You\\ncouldn’t simply add a new data set or integrate two different data sets because it took way too much\\ntime and effort. Finally, within this organization there was not a lack of a data strategy, but a need to\\nattain a data strategy that suited the organization.\\nAssessing the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nA major challenge for this organization was translating and advocating the change across the organization\\nas a whole. It turned out to be very important to leverage the right people who had the right influence\\non the organization. In addition, it appeared that the top management was very engaged and understood\\nthe value of the Data Mesh, which allowed them to encourage the change from the executives. This\\nincreased the desire to transition within the organization as a whole. In addition, they had large R&D\\nteams, so that the value of innovation was also strongly recognized in the organization. One of the other\\nchallenges for this organization was the right Business & IT alignment. It was difficult to move away\\nfrom the centralized team. The decentralized approach required a new perspective on the central team,\\nin the sense that they were seen as enablers for executing the tasks within the Data Mesh architecture,\\nrather than as executors of the tasks themselves.\\nAssessing the preparedness to migrate to a Data Mesh\\nIn terms of preparedness, this organization has developed a program that would redesign the entire\\norganization, processes, in and around the domains and the teams, involving the entire business. This\\nprogram was run in tandem with the entire organization, allowing it to act as a foundation for the\\nmigration process. This program also included the new rules and guidelines, and the standardized Data\\nMesh-specific processes. With regard to governance, its implementation was a lengthy process, which\\nin particular showed that enabling interoperability and collaboration was very important. In addition,', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 59}),\n",

Standards and guidelines are needed for this, and time had\\nto be invested in supervising and structuring the migration. They started with providing only the initial\\ndomains guidelines with standards, after which they looked at how the domains would grow in the new\\nway of working. Good use of structures and guidelines helped in this regard.\\n5.3 results of the case studies\\nTable 5.2 presents the results of the assessment as performed at the case study organizations.\\nTable 5.2: Assessment results of the conducted case studies\\nCase Readiness Assessment Results\\n1Almost\\nreadyCurrent readiness phase : 3 - Assessing the preparedness for migration\\nProposed improvement area : the biggest challenges currently still being within\\nthe institutional implementations, i.e. the right guidelines and governance\\nstrategies require the most attention so far.\\nFurther recommendation : design a governance model that fits the structure of\\nthe organization and implement it with the participation of all employees.\\n2 ReadyCurrent readiness phase : 4 - Determining readiness\\nProposed improvement area : identifying teething problems and detailed\\nstructures within the institutional setting.\\nFurther recommendation : the assessment shows that certain measurements are\\nstill needed in the coming years to determine whether the new architecture can\\nmeet its objectives.

Based on this, new improvement areas\\ncan be identified.\\n5.4 insights from the case studies\\nThe case studies started with general questions about Data Mesh architectures. These questions were\\nintended to find out to what extent the interviewee has encountered a Data Mesh implementation, as well\\nas common barriers for organizations to start with a Data Mesh migration. In addition, these questions\\nallowed to determine the interviewee’s perspective on Data Mesh architectures.\\n5.4.1 Data Mesh in practice\\nNearly all interviewees of the case studies indicated that Data Mesh architectures are still very rare in\\npractice. This may be because the organizations are not yet ready for it, or because they do not know\\nhow to get started.\\n”I have been working on a Data Mesh implementation model. I think I might have one that\\nwill work, but I am also finding that a lot of organizations think they’re not quite ready yet. ”\\n(Interviewee N)\\n”I’d say that there is not a standard way of implementing a Data Mesh in organizations. I\\ntry to look at all the principles and see what fits best for the organization. ” (Interviewee R)', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 52\\n5.4.2 Insights about assessing the need\\nAssessing the need\\nWith respect to assessing the needs for a Data Mesh architecture, the case studies have shown that\\nmany of these needs are interrelated. The need that emerges most often and can therefore be considered\\nimportant is the need for greater autonomy for domain teams . However, the autonomy is related\\nto the need for more upstream responsibility , because ultimately there is an overarching need within\\norganizations for better understandability, discoverability, trustworthiness and quality of the data to be\\nconsumed. Organizations want to work more data-driven, and therefore be able to base their decision-\\nmaking on data that is reliable for this. Interviewee X underlines this new way of working:\\n”In terms of whether there’s the need for domain teams to be able to do their own data\\nanalysis, I definitely think that this is important. I think this is mostly not the case in\\ncompanies that go into Data Mesh. Domain teams are not independent enough. Domains\\nneed to be able to do their own analysis and make their own data products. ” (Interviewee\\nX)\\nInterviewee T also indicates that it is important to be able to trust the data:\\n”The lack of ownership in particular gives bigger problems because people just don’t trust\\nthe data. They don’t trust the data that is given to them. ” (Interviewee T)\\nClosely aligned to this, a more practical need is the need for shorter lead times from operational\\nteams to data analytics teams . During the case studies, this was mostly identified as the ’pain felt\\nby the data teams’ .\\n”I think this is really closely related to the need for greater scalability. And why is there\\na need for greater scalability? Because there is a bottleneck in the centralized data team.\\nThey are not able to fulfill the requests that they are getting, so the lead times are too long.\\nSo for sure, to me, this is one of the most important needs. ” (Interviewee R)\\nOf the other identified needs, a few emerged during the case studies. In addition, it appeared that it is\\nimportant to align the interpretation of the needs with the assessment:\\n”For us, it was more the case that we had too much autonomy for the teams. They were\\ntoo independent of each other, and they didn’t think of the other when determining the data\\nthey needed. There was no awareness of how to prepare this data so that the other teams\\ncould use it in an efficient way. ” (Interviewee O)\\nWhen assessing the need for greater flexibility of the data platform and the need for greater scal-\\nability of the data platform , this is identified as something that is needed among organizations.\\n”They also had been a company that had grown through acquisition and had several disparate\\ngroups that had implemented independently for a long time. They had these individual silos\\nthat didn’t cross talk very well. They were in the situation where you end up with siloed\\ninformation, siloed activities and duplication of efforts. It is very hard to make changes to\\nthese kind of systems. ” (Interviewee N)\\n”I think this builds up on beneath the need for greater autonomy, the more flexible the data\\nplatform, the less lead time there is, and the easier it is to consume the data products. Data', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 53\\nengineers need a data infrastructure that meets their needs, so it is easier for them to make\\ngood data products for their consumers. ” (Interviewee O)\\n”Yes, the platform needs to be flexible and that is what most platforms are not currently.\\nHowever, within the Data Mesh, there also has to be standards, which shouldn’t be changed.\\nSo this is a tough one to assess. ” (Interviewee R)\\nFinally, the need for a data strategy and the need for reduced cognitive load for data engineering\\nteams are two needs that are more difficult to find consensus on among the interviewees. In the first\\ncase, this is mainly because there is a data strategy within organizations, but that strategy is often not\\nnecessarily the best strategy for that specific organization. This can lead to inefficiencies in the business\\nprocess or decision-making, which may lead to a need for a more structured approach:\\n”I think there is this need for a data strategy that fits the organization. The company fails to\\nidentify what is the right strategy for itself. And when they actually do have a strategy, they\\nneed to actually implement it. I think this operationalization is what is lacking. ” (Interviewee\\nT)\\nIn addition, some case studies showed that there were not necessarily too few data engineers in the\\norganization who have too high a cognitive load, but that these teams have too little knowledge of\\nthe purpose of the data they process. Although there are indeed organizations that suffer from a large\\noverload in the data engineering teams, part of the problem is addressed by giving the engineering teams\\nmore business context:\\n”I think there will never be enough data engineers when you keep on not sharing the domain\\nknowledge. And I think you need to enable data engineers to understand just so much from\\nthe domain that they can make wise decisions. So this need is clearly addressed by a Data\\nMesh architecture. You need the cross-functional teams. I come from the semantic data\\nmodeling team, and we try to put semantics or be very careful for how we call column names\\nor tables. Because it’s a way of communication. By thinking carefully about how you call\\nthings, you can reduce the cognitive load for those who need the data. ” (Interviewee O)\\n”Sometimes data engineering teams, they don’t have business context at all. They’re still\\nrequired to do data transformation of domain teams. They make many efforts to maintain\\nand transform data that they don’t know of, and of which they don’t know any business\\ncontext. So yes, this is a big driver for a Data Mesh. ” (Interviewee R)\\nConcluding, it seems that most of the needs that point towards a Data Mesh architecture as a solution\\nare intertwined. During the assessments, it was hard to tick all the boxes, since the problems felt by\\nthe organization mostly point towards the same direction. The model was used for targeting specific\\nparts of the organization by encouraging the organization to think closely about the exact location of its\\nexperienced bottlenecks. Moreover, it was concluded from the case studies that the needs in the model\\nshould be ranked by importance, in order to guide the organization towards the Problem Identification\\nand the main problems encountered.\\n5.4.3 Insights about assessing the ability to change\\nWillingness to Change\\nStarting with the desire to transition , it seemed important to identify where this desire comes from\\nwithin the organization. From the demonstration of the readiness assessment, it turned out that it is', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 63}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 54\\nimportant to find this desire throughout the entire organization, so bottom-up as well as top-down. The\\ndesire can also be motivated, for example by introducing organization-wide programs and workshops.\\nAccording to interviewee R, it is most important to have this desire to transition coming from the\\ndomains:\\n”To me, it is important to identify where this desire comes from. It can come from a\\ncentralized team that decides that a Data Mesh is the way to go, or it can come from the\\ndomains itself, demanding a greater autonomy. I think, the main important thing is that it\\ncomes from the domains. The domains need to take this responsibility. ” (Interviewee R)\\nInterviewee Z, on the other hand, believed that this desire to transition was best spread from the executive\\nlevel:\\n”We started talking with the executives, in order for them to understand the concept. When\\nthey started understanding why you would need a Data Mesh and data products, they spread\\nthe word to other people in the organization, both publicly via videos and announcements,\\nas during their meetings. The ball started rolling, and the desire to transition became bigger\\nand bigger. ” (Interviewee T)\\nMoreover, the existence of a learning culture and an innovation culture was discussed during the case\\nstudies. Although these terms were often used interchangeably in the case studies, the importance of\\neducation and freedom of experimentation was often emphasized. This can be achieved, for example, by\\nestablished R&D teams, knowledge sharing platforms, and having executives who push innovation into\\nthe company. It turned out to be important to realize that many people in the organization had to be\\nupskilled for the migration, and that this would take time and effort.\\n”I would assess learning culture in terms of upskilling the domain teams. What you see\\nsometimes is that these domains, they don’t actually have the skills to create and maintain\\ndata products. And that is actually a big deal. So for me, learning culture, and desire to\\ntransition are really close to each other. If you want to learn, you will want to transition into\\nsomething where you have greater autonomy. ” (Interviewee R)\\n”I think one of the first things that I’ve observed is that they need to start thinking about\\ndata as products. It’s an innovative approach towards what organizations are doing right\\nnow, but it’s crucial for a Data Mesh to function. ” (Interviewee N)\\n”We introduce data through culture, through education. You have to educate people, via\\nworkshops or lectures. You also have to encourage people to be willing to learn and invest\\ntime in it. ” (Interviewee R)\\nVision\\nWhen discussing the factors clearly defined objectives andclearly defined value statements during\\nthe case studies, it turned out that most organizations have their main objective for a Data Mesh\\narchitecture formulated as a desire to become more data-driven . However, it is important to define\\nthese objectives and values in a concrete and executable manner, in order to achieve objectives from\\ndifferent points of views within the organization. Eventually, the overarching objective is mostly to take\\nbetter decisions based on insights from the data, but due to the lengthy process associated with a Data\\nMesh migration, it is important to set concrete goals from all corners of the organization that are also\\nfeasible.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 55\\n”At the end of the day, everybody wants to become data-driven. And everybody wants to\\nmake decisions based on facts. But the problem is that that is the objective of any data\\nstrategy, not only the one for a Data Mesh. What we really need to do is to see what we are\\ntrying to achieve from different point of views. In terms of high level and low level objectives,\\nand strategical and tactical objectives, which should happen over time. ” (Interviewee T)\\n”You should define the objectives based on the needs. These needs define the end goal that\\nyou try to move forward to. ” (Interviewee R)\\n”In my opinion, it is what leads people to decide to go for a Data Mesh, because they\\nunderstand the value of it for their data processing. ” (Interviewee O)\\nBusiness Case\\nConcerning the business & IT alignment , the problem was often experienced that the business side and\\nthe IT side of the organization were very far apart in terms of goals, means and data awareness.\\n”In my company, it wasn’t very much aligned. The business side and the IT side both really\\nneeded to understand that we’re now going to deal with data as a product. That really took\\na while. The organization gradually understood that they had to make teams mandate more\\ndata awareness, in order for the Data Mesh to work. There is this growing awareness, but\\nyou have to understand the basic principles of data. ” (Interviewee O)\\n”We’ve made a concerted effort to ensure that if this alignment isn’t already there, we work\\nto demonstrate the value of the project itself. This can actually come through metrics.\\nWe found that key performance indicators are a good way to influence change in business.\\nAlignment often boils down to how you are measuring your success. ” (Interviewee N)\\nAccording to the case studies, this gap can be filled in various ways, for example through value demon-\\nstrations, workshops or spreading the word. The case studies of Interviewee P and Interviewee R even\\nshowed that assigning authority to different domains automatically narrows this gap.\\n”There’s always this problem with business and IT being on different pages. Technology\\nis worried about stuff like security, which is why they want all others to access their data.\\nBusiness on the other sight wants to access the data, but are receiving the wrong data.\\nYou just need everybody from the entire organization to think about it, so everybody is\\norganized around domains. These domains will help gain alignment between business and\\nIT. ” (Interviewee P)\\n”To me, it depends on the organization. I’ve seen companies in which architects started to\\nbuild some enormous database, in which they evangelize everything they need, thinking that\\neverybody wants to move towards this. But then the business is not even really aware that\\nthis is happening. The other way around, you have the domains claiming that they want to\\nhave more responsibility, whereas they’re not given any since they don’t have that authority.\\nSo this is something that is really important. ” (Interviewee R)\\nCombining the different views from the different case studies, it seems that the business & IT alignment\\nis something that needs to be put in place in order to be ready for a Data Mesh. Especially within large\\norganizations, it is important that the business side of the organization understands the value of data.\\nThere are various strategies and ways to try to align the business and IT sides of organizations, but the\\ncommon thought is that they need to be aligned and that that challenge needs to be thought through\\nvery carefully.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 65}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 56\\nLeadership\\nAccording to all case study interviewees, top-management engagement is a prerequisite for Data Mesh\\nreadiness. Since all interviewees were able to indicate almost immediately whether this engagement was\\nthere or not, and then indicated that it was very important to have top management engagement, there\\nhas not been much discussion about this factor.\\n”It is all about whether your business leaders, as in your executives and non-technical people,\\nunderstand it. If they’re not excited about it, then you haven’t completed the first readiness\\nstate properly. If they really understand the need, the transition can succeed. ” (Interviewee\\nN)\\n”The players on both sides need to be on board. For example the head of the domains,\\nin more of a business capability. So the head of strategy, or people working really closely\\nto strategy and want to become more data driven, they need to understand why data is a\\nbenefit for them to become more data driven. But on the other side, you’ll also need the\\nCTOs, they need to buy into this whole contract. ” (Interviewee R)\\n”For us, it was a bottom-up approach, because the pain was felt on the bottom. I think\\nthat top-management is too far away from everyday life to really feel it. But we had top-\\nmanagement who were really good listeners, and they understood our problems. Those\\nwords have to merge. ” (Interviewee O)\\nEnterprise Ability\\nOne of the more complex aspects of Data Mesh readiness is assessing the enterprise’s ability to decen-\\ntralize the business into domains , and the ability to decouple the existing business applications .\\nAll in all, it turned out that it is a very iterative process, and that you can initially start from the existing\\nbusiness domains. However, there will often still be a shift in the boundaries of the domains and the\\nprecise tasks and responsibilities between the domains. In addition, it can be difficult to decouple the\\nexisting applications in a decentralized way. It can come in handy to use a good data virtualization\\nmechanism, to enable the reuse of data sets from domains. In addition, the central platform and the\\ncentral IT team play a major role in decentralization and decoupling, because they must be able to\\nenable the interoperability of the various components within the Data Mesh. All in all, many different\\napproaches have emerged from the case studies to tackle these challenges, but it has been identified by\\nall case studies as a very important step in determining the readiness for a Data Mesh architecture.\\nSome case studies indicated that it was very difficult to divide the business up in domains:\\n”Dividing your business into domains itself is difficult, especially in defining where to put\\nthe right level of abstraction. I think the processes are always much more important than\\nthe domains. I have a tendency to think more in service design and processes, rather than\\ndomains. To me, the right way of organizing would be in terms of processes. ” (Interviewee\\nO)\\nOthers suggested that the domains might even already exist within the company:\\n”I think sometimes, the domains exist already. And so I think companies have the ability to\\ncreate these domains. However, especially traditional companies, have the problem that IT\\nhas been centralized. So traditional IT is very centralized, and is not catered in decentralizing\\nin the domain-driven design way. I think the business is already more decentralized in this', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 66}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 57\\nmanner, but IT has traditionally been centralized. To me, that’s where the challenges lie. ”\\n(Interviewee S)\\nThis interviewee used existing principles from the domain-driven design approach to structure the process\\nof decentralization:\\n”We realized that the technical architecture should follow the business architecture. The\\norganization has domains, they are the natural implementation of the business architecture.\\nThe point is that we wish that the technical implementation should follow this business\\narchitecture. We used the idea of bounded context from the domain-driven design principles\\nas major design aspect of domain distribution. It should some kind of prerequisite for Data\\nMesh to have some idea on the decentralization of your business. ” (Interviewee Q)\\nWith respect to the decoupling of business applications, some case studies pointed out that this decou-\\npling process is a prerequisite for the performance of the Data Mesh:\\n”We basically want to provide self-serve infrastructure to the different domains. So these\\ndomains will have their own resources in the cloud, to make their own data products. And\\nthese data products need to be completely decoupled, because they belong to that domain.\\nThere will be some sort of standard interface where other domains can consume these data\\nproducts. It is very important that these applications can actually be decoupled, but also\\nthat they can be consumed in a standard way. ” (Interviewee R)\\nWhile others believe that there are alternative ways to address this challenge:\\n”If you provide the right data virtualization and a platform that enables the accessing and\\nsharing of data without having to make copies, completely decoupling applications is not\\nnecessary to achieve the correct cross-collaboration of domains. ” (Interviewee S)\\nLastly, there needs to be an ability to work in domain teams , especially with regards to the people\\nthat are going to work in the domains.\\n”In the past, these people were consumers of data. They were able to consume their data\\nin an ad hoc manner, but they didn’t own any data products at all. And now, we’re giving\\nthem the resources to actually own the data product as a whole, and I think this is a very\\nbig shift. It is a very important but challenging task to teach them the ability to work in a\\ndata domain. ” (Interviewee R)\\nIn conclusion from the case studies, the ability to adapt the design of your data architecture to the\\ndecentralized nature of a Data Mesh can be one of the biggest challenges when preparing for a migration\\nto a Data Mesh architecture. It is important for organizations to assess this ability before embarking on\\nthe journey as it is one of the biggest tasks in the process. During the demonstration of the readiness\\nassessment, it appeared that organizations find it difficult to estimate this ability for themselves, and\\nthat the set of follow-up questions was often used to guide them in this assessment.\\n5.4.4 Insights about assessing the preparedness for change\\nAccountability\\nWith respect to accountability, an identified factor is having clearly defined roles and responsibilities .\\nThis means that every domain should have a data product owner or data product manager, in one of', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 58\\nthe domain roles. These roles and responsibilities should be correctly described, which can be offloaded\\nwith data ownership guidelines and Service Level Agreements.\\nAccording to interviewee T, these roles and responsibilities should be defined from the beginning on in\\norder to avoid confusion with respect to the rightful owner of the data:\\n”When I see this factor, I think we could have done this better ourselves from the start. We\\nhave started taking temporary ownership of data products, as a trial. We figured out how\\nto find the right people for the right data products. The problem with that is that when you\\nwork with temporary ownership, there are still many cases where the owner of the data does\\nnot know everything about the data itself. As a result, the data product can still not be used\\nproperly. I don’t believe that having data engineers in the domains is a prerequisite from the\\nstart, as long as you have defined ownership of the data well and clearly. The person knows\\nthe use cases for his own data and guarantees its quality. ” (Interviewee T)\\nInterviewee U states that their organization uses performance indicators to see whether the quality of\\nthe data is maintained correctly by its owners:\\n”In order to test the right accountability, you could measure the outcome of the domains.\\nFor example what you do with any other activity in organizations, like KPIs for data quality.\\nDomains should be independent in how they achieve this quality, but you need to have some\\nkind of common standard of measuring quality, in order to see if this ownership is correctly\\nappointed. ” (Interviewee O)\\nContrary to some case studies, interviewee R argues that it is in principle the responsibility of the domains\\nto define the roles and responsibilities, as long as they continue to comply with the set global rules and\\nguidelines set by the central teams:\\n”Apart from the roles and the responsibilities in the domains, it is also important to define\\nwhat is the responsibility of the centralized platform that still provides components to these\\ndomains. That’s on a higher level, but within the domains there also should be clear respon-\\nsibilities. What is the data product owner? What does the rest of the teams do? However,\\nthe way they address this appointment, is up to the domains itself. They should have some\\ndegree of freedom in order to decide on their inner processes, as long as they adhere to the\\nstandards of the Data Mesh. ” (Interviewee R)\\nIn conclusion, it can be stated that when assessing the degree of preparedness for a Data Mesh migration,\\nthe correct appointment of roles and responsibilities must always be taken into account. How this is\\narranged within the domains, either by pre-defining those roles and responsibilities, or by leaving this\\nappointment to the domain itself, is something in which the practices of the case studies performed\\ndiffer.\\nGovernance\\nWith respect to governance, the exploratory interviews have shown that this could be designed in several\\nways. For example, a governance forum could be established, in which data producers and data consumers\\ncan be brought together in order to be part of the decision making. However, the governance in a Data\\nMesh should be distributed onto the domains with some sort of rules, guidelines and policies what their\\ndata products should adhere to.\\nInterviewee S believes that federalized governance must have some or some degree of central leader-\\nship:', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 59\\nWithin a federalized governance model, there must always be a centrally organized team that\\ncan enforce the global rules. Without this central team it is impossible to impose specific\\npolicies and procedures throughout the organisation. The federated character of this model\\nthen mainly covers the inner workings of the domains and the way in which they operate\\nwithin their domain, as long as they comply with global standards. (Interviewee S)\\nInterviewee N, on the other hand, indicates that according to his organization, care should be taken with\\nthe amount of central leadership, because according to them this could lead to new bottlenecks:\\n”If the governance was very centralized and top down, the Data Mesh wouldn’t work. What\\nwill happen is that the central governance group will become the bottleneck to the overall\\nsystem, because it is a centralized resource that doesn’t scale with the rest of the organization.\\nSo the governance has to be distributed as well. ” (Interviewee N)\\nInterviewee R indicates that there is a balance between centralized and decentralized governance, and\\nthat the degree of democratization in particular has proven to be important for success:\\n”So you could have two separate teams that are working on governance, but with different\\ngoals. On the one side, you have the centralized data platform team, who define the\\nguidelines of what the standards should be of the data products. And then on the other\\nhand, you have the federated governance team members within the domains, who make sure\\nthat these rules, guidelines and standards are enforced within the domains as well. But these\\nteams need to be working together very closely, in a fully democratized way. ” (Interviewee\\nR)\\nBoth the exploratory interviews and the case studies showed that especially the interpretation of the\\nfederalized governance model differs among all participants in this study. This difference therefore also\\nindicates that the way in which governance within a Data Mesh should be set up is not yet completely\\nclear and understandable, and that there is still plenty of experimentation going on. The consensus that\\ndid exist among the case studies is that at least certain policies, standards and guidelines are needed to\\nenable sharing and access of data products between the domains in a trustworthy manner.\\nWorkable Approach\\nOne factor within the dimension Workable Approach is communication guidelines . These guidelines\\ndefine how to work together to build a data product, in a multidisciplinary way. They also align cross\\ndomain collaboration through data exchange. Within the case studies, it resulted in different perspectives\\namong the interviewees.\\n”To me, this collaboration is already defined through the interoperability policy and the\\ndocumentation policy. I think the collaboration doesn’t really need guidelines, but it needs a\\nplace to be able to collaborate with each other. Since domains have some interdependencies,\\nyet still it is only the final products that they expose. ” (Interviewee O)\\n”Domains do need some sort of guidelines in which they understand what is the best way of\\ndoing things, and maybe what sort of skills they need to become data driven. But for sure,\\nthis isn’t something that should be enforced, since it is still up to the domains to decide on\\nhow to collaborate and communicate. ” (Interviewee R)\\nOn the other hand, with respect to data literacy guidelines , these guidelines define how to work on\\nthe infrastructure that the organization provides to support the Data Mesh. Moreover, these guidelines', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 60\\nshow how to work with the tools that are used within the domains. According to the interviewees from\\nthe case studies, data literacy is mostly about upskilling the people in the domains.\\n”I think that workable approach is mostly about skills and literacy. You need some data\\ntraining, some necessary skill set. How do we build up these skills?” (Interviewee O)\\nMoreover, some case studies related the workable approach within the Data Mesh with the existence of\\naknowledge sharing platform , that was implemented in order to support the learning culture:\\n”Implement knowledge exchange sessions, in which the engineers and analysts can discuss\\nwhat they are doing within the domains, what technologies they are using, and the lessons\\nlearned from the Data Mesh performance. ” (Interviewee R)\\nIT Capacity\\nWith respect to the Workable Approach, there were varying perspectives on the level of automation\\nand standardization there should be on the way of working within the Data Mesh. Most case studies\\napproached having CI/CD standards andautomation standards are identified as nice-to-have features,\\nbut not necessary for the performance of a Data Mesh:\\n”It is up to the domains whether they want to use CI/CD. In order to help the domains that\\nwish to have these, the central platform team could provide some of these standards, which\\ncan be easily implemented within the domains. But it is going to be up to the domains to\\ndecide whether they want to use them. ” (Interviewee R)\\n”CI/CD standards and automation standards really improve the way of working for a Data\\nMesh, but they shouldn’t become a barrier for people starting to implement a Data Mesh.\\nThese features would be very nice to have, but they aren’t necessary for the working of a\\nData Mesh and shouldn’t scare people willing to implement it. ” (Interviewee O)\\nHowever, the case study of Interviewee N showed that these CI/CD standards were the enabling mecha-\\nnism for the development of the Data Mesh performance:\\n”What usually is not considered, is what happens when I change a column in a data product\\nthat is used by consumers. New standards need to be thought of to prevent breaking use\\ncases for downstream users. This really comes back to the thinking of data as a product.\\nTo us, CI/CD was a mechanism that accomplished that. ” (Interviewee N)\\nLikewise, Interviewee T agreed upon the importance of CI/CD standards in a Data Mesh architec-\\nture:\\n”If you don’t do CI/CD, and foremost Continuous Deployment, you are going to be really\\nslow. Especially when you need to manage multiple data products, you will need continuous\\ndeployment. The same thing holds for automation. Whenever you want to scale, you need\\nautomation in place. And Data Mesh is all about scalability. Maybe the first month that\\nyou are trying out the Data Mesh you don’t care too much about the automation. But the\\nmoment that you start scaling, you need it. ” (Interviewee T)\\nLastly, according to all case studies, having data publication standards is identified as crucial for the\\nperformance of a Data Mesh:', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.4. INSIGHTS FROM THE CASE STUDIES 61\\n”At the end of the day, the data product publication standards are the most important,\\nto make sure that the publication of the data products enables interoperability between\\nthe domains. It is up to the domains you they go about automating and deploying this\\npublication, but the publication standards have to be met. ” (Interviewee R)\\nEnterprise Capacity\\nWith respect to Enterprise Capacity, one of the factors that was identified was the ability of an agile\\nway of working . The exploratory interviews identified this factor as important, since it speeds up the\\ntime to market of specific publications, something that is needed within a Data Mesh.\\n”My own personal views is that anything you design is wrong, either currently because\\nyou didn’t fully understand the problem or requirements, or eventually because something\\nchanges. A company has to be agile, it has to be constantly moving forward and evolving. ”\\n(Interviewee N)\\n”I think an agile way of working is needed for anything. But actually even more important\\nis the ability to enable the domains to make their own decisions. So if the domains decide\\nto not work agile, that’s up to them. ” (Interviewee S)\\nLastly within this factor dimension, was having team structures aligned with the business domains .\\nThese teams are already business aligned in terms of that they’re having a responsibility for a certain\\npart of the business. Moreover, this brings them closer to the business case, which might enhance\\nresponsibility and motivation for the business processes. The case studies have shown that this is not\\nthe case for every organization, because the perspectives of the interviewees differed greatly on this\\nfactor. The case study with interviewee R showed that most teams are business aligned, but that there\\nare always teams left in the mesh that are not aligned with the business.\\n”I think this is an interesting view. I don’t think this counts for every case. For example,\\nthe consumer aligned domains can be really business focused. But what about the source\\naligned domains, like the teams that maintain the systems, who don’t really have a business\\ndomain. They’re actually maintaining the ERP or CRM system. These teams could be a\\ndomain team as well, but they could also be part of the central IT team. But they are very\\nimportant, since they are the provider of the data. ” (Interviewee R)\\nInterviewee T believes it is necessary to align the domain teams with the business to preserve domain\\nknowledge:\\n”You have to have some degree of this alignment in a sense, because you want to have\\nspecific domain knowledge in your domains. This requires a team structure alignment with\\nthe business. With this domain knowledge you don’t have to figure out every time how\\nto tackle certain domain-specific issues. There is one team that is not aligned with the\\nbusiness, and that is the team that builds the platform. They serve the entire community. ”\\n(Interviewee T)\\n5.4.5 Insights about determining the readiness\\nData Mesh Building Blocks\\nThe Data Mesh building blocks are self-organizing and autonomous domain teams enabled by a self-\\nserve platform , having a central IT team , having domain representatives in the governance team ,', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 71}),\n",

CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS 62\\nhaving a self-serve platform and having a central data catalog with DATSIS (i.e. discoverable,\\naddressable, trustworthy, self-describing, interoperable and secure) data products .\\n5.5 cross-case analysis\\n5.5.1 The needs of organizations\\nWhen assessing Data Mesh readiness, the case studies have shown that the motivation and need for a\\ndata mesh architecture within organizations often come from different angles. While one organization\\nmainly needs more autonomy for the business domains and shorter lead times between requests, the\\nother organization mainly needs structure, responsibilities and general data awareness. It seems that the\\nmore data mature and data driven an organization is, the more it tends to the former. Organizations\\nthat want to become more data-driven often use that need as a driver for a Data Mesh architecture.\\nIt has therefore proved difficult during the case studies to tick all the needs as specified in the DMRM\\nwithin one organization. In practice, it often comes down to a combination of different needs, and the\\nneeds from the model do help organizations to become more aware of these specific needs.\\nA special insight from this phase is that although Data Mesh is often compared to other distributed\\narchitectures such as a Microservices design, none of the case studies had implemented such a Microser-\\nvices design prior to the Data Mesh in the organization itself. This indicates that while already having a\\ndecentralized architecture is probably a good starting point for expanding to a Data Mesh architecture,\\nwhile in practice that is often not the case. One reason for this could be that the drivers behind the\\nimplementation of a Microservices architecture often came from the software development angle and are\\nalso often implemented as a technological solution focused on the interoperability of services (Krivic et\\nal., 2018), while a Data Mesh architecture is almost completely separate from a technological solution\\nand is usually evoked from a organizational motivation behind data issues. The two different distributed\\narchitectures thus function as other total solutions for other challenges within organizations, and should\\ntherefore also be used for different purposes.\\n5.5.2 The ability of organizations to migrate\\nThe ability of organizations to migrate to a Data Mesh architecture is mainly determined in the model in\\nresponse to high-level requirements. These requirements are mainly within the cultural and organizational\\ncontext, because during the exploratory interviews it often turned out that these are important precon-\\nditions for a successful Data Mesh migration. During the case studies, these factors were fairly easy to\\nidentify. What emerged is that there were many different perspectives and interpretations about the way\\nin which organizations decentralize their central data platform towards a distributed architecture.\\nGetting business and IT aligned\\nOne of the current discussion points within this topic is the alignment of business and IT. Although\\nmany different organizations approach achieving this alignment in different ways, there is a consensus\\nthat having this alignment is very important in terms of readiness for Data Mesh architectures. Most\\ncase studies showed that in many cases this alignment does not exist: the business does not see the\\nvalue of IT and vice versa. One way to bring these groups closer together turned out to be possible\\nto discuss data awareness and the value of data for the organization, so that especially on the business\\nside of organizations more value is seen in the use of data for decision-making. The moment they\\nunderstand that having and understanding data is an important requirement for the performance of the\\nbusiness, it is easier to implement data-driven transformations within the organization. It turned out to', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 72}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.5. CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS 63\\nbe important to align the tasks of the data teams within organizations with what the business sees as\\nthe most important conditions for good performance.\\nThe process of decentralization\\nRegarding the process of decentralizing and splitting the existing monolithic data platform in the orga-\\nnization, some of the case studies showed that it can be good to start with domains that are eager to\\nbecome autonomous. In this way, these domains can serve as proof of concept, and also provide support\\nfor the migration within the organization. The domains most hindered by the centralization of the data\\narchitecture also have sufficient motivation to help with the iterative and lengthy process. In addition,\\nthere was little consensus among the case studies about the best way to approach the decentralization\\nprocess: while one interviewee believes that the existing business domains already exist and it is therefore\\neasy to identify domains, the other interviewee believes that this is a lengthy and painful process that\\noften has to be redone. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that it is in any case a process\\nthat needs to be paid a lot of attention when determining readiness for a Data Mesh architecture. It\\nseems that at least a structured and well-thought-out approach helps to prevent or reduce chaos during\\nthe decentralization process.\\nDecoupling existing business applications\\nEspecially from the critics of the Data Mesh architecture there is doubt about the connection of the Data\\nMesh architecture with the application level within organizations. Within various case studies, existing\\napplications were compared with the solutions that the Data Mesh offers or insufficiently offers. By\\nenabling the discussion on this point, it became apparent that it is very organization dependent on what\\nchoices are made within the Data Mesh for certain enabling technologies that make the operation possible.\\nIt turned out to be important to realize that the concept of a Data Mesh mainly revolves around the\\norganization, architectural decisions for moving data and governance, and that the choice of technology\\nshould mainly be seen as an executive decision rather than an organizational priority. Organizations make\\ndifferent choices about which technology to use, while still similarly complying with the organizational\\nphilosophy that the Data Mesh concept advocates (I. A. Machado et al., 2022a).\\n5.5.3 Preparing for a Data Mesh architecture\\nDuring a number of case studies, doubts arose whether the step of assessing preparedness really belongs\\nto a readiness assessment, or whether it leans more towards execution instead of readiness. Within\\nthis study, it was decided to keep the preparedness component in the assessment, because it can also\\nbe useful to determine the extent of preparation when you want to assess your readiness for migration\\nto a Data Mesh architecture. In addition, the case studies have shown that good preparation for the\\nmigration can contribute to a better adaptation of the organization to the Data Mesh architecture. The\\npreparedness as measured in the DMRM covers the formal rules and guidelines that must be established\\nin order to meet the institutional boundaries of a Data Mesh.\\nCommunication and collaboration\\nWithin the case studies, a link to collaboration often arose during the discussion about communication.\\nIt is therefore not only about the move towards a model in which someone takes ownership of the data\\nproduct, but also about enabling collaboration on it in a multidisciplinary way. Questions that arose\\nrelated to the requirements for this collaboration and how you can work together to build a data product.\\nA shared opinion within this dimension is that bringing different disciplines together contributes to a large\\nextent to communication and collaboration, simply by reducing the distance between the disciplines. In\\naddition, having certain communication guidelines can contribute to communication between domains\\nthat are very far apart, but this is not a prerequisite for preparing for a Data Mesh migration. It is often', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n",

CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS 64\\nabout getting enough common ground among the domain teams so that they understand each other\\nwhat they are doing, and upskilling the people that lack knowledge about it, in order to enable the entire\\ndomain to work autonomously. The way in which domains work together internally is basically up to the\\ndomains themselves to determine, due to the autonomous nature of the Data Mesh architecture.\\nGovernance\\nA much discussed point during the case studies was the way of designing the governance model in a\\nData Mesh architecture. Some organizations initially opt for a minimally federalized governance model,\\nin which only a number of global rules are enforced that ensure that the performance of the Data Mesh\\nwill in any case remain within the applicable governmental rules. Other organizations chose to design\\nthe entire federalized governance model from scratch, including a central governance team, so that all\\ninstitutional preconditions were in place before starting the migration. A consensus that can be found\\nwithin this dimension is that there should in any case be standards about publishing, sharing and accessing\\ndata between the domains in order to guarantee interoperability. In addition, many organizations leave\\nthe way in which data products are built to the domains themselves, as long as their output complies\\nwith the guidelines. With regard to Data Mesh readiness, it turned out to be important to involve as\\nmany people as possible within the organization in the decision-making process when drawing up this\\ngovernance model, so that a large organizational base can arise for the new democratized governance\\nmodel.\\nCI/CD and automation standards\\nA dimension where it was more difficult to find consensus among the case studies was the IT capacity\\nand data maturity of organizations. Standards regarding CI/CD and automation were seen by some\\ninterviewees as necessary for the functioning of the Data Mesh, while other interviewees saw these\\nstandards as a ’nice-to-have’ feature. An analysis of the different cases shows that with regard to this\\ndimension it can be stated that organizations should not be deterred by these maturity standards. A\\ncertain degree of automation and CI/CD does contribute to an efficient and fast performance of the\\nnew distributed design of the data architecture, but it is not an organizational capability that must be\\nestablished from the start. When assessing the readiness of an organization for the migration to a Data\\nMesh, it is therefore not a priority to have these standards in place, because it is not a precondition\\nfor Data Mesh readiness. It was decided to keep these factors within the model, but with a lower\\npriority, because when using the DMRM iteratively, these factors can be implemented over-time within\\nan organization to improve overall data maturity towards readiness for the Data Mesh migration.\\nInter-domain dependencies\\nWhen assessing readiness for a Data Mesh migration, the issue of how to deal with inter-domain depen-\\ndencies often arose. Because the domains often work together on data and insights from the data, it is\\nimportant that this collaboration can be reliable and structured. It could happen within organizations\\nthat one domain is dependent on the other domain for certain data, but that the prioritization of this\\ndata is not the same between these domains. To increase the reliability of the cross-collaboration within\\nthe organizations, many organizations chose to draw up release management contracts and Service Level\\nAgreements, which specifically state who owns the data so that consumers know what to expect from\\nthe data product.\\nTeam structures alignment\\nA final analysis of the case studies is about the way of structuring the teams. The case studies have\\nshown that it is valuable to structure the domain teams according to the existing business domains, in\\norder to maintain domain expertise in the new Data Mesh domain teams. However, the case analyses', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='5.6. CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS 65\\nand refinement sessions have also shown that it is not always possible to structure these teams aligned\\nwith the business domains themselves. One reason for this is that there are often teams within the\\norganization that are not business aligned, such as the maintainers of ERP or CRM systems, where the\\npeople who understand these complex systems and can extract data from them are often scarce resources.\\nThe question arises whether you want these teams in domains or in a central IT team. A clear answer\\nto this issue has not emerged from the case studies, so it depends on the organization whether you want\\nthese teams in the central IT team, or whether you hold the domains responsible for the extraction of\\nits own data.\\n5.5.4 Determining Data Mesh Readiness\\nDetermining readiness for a Data Mesh architecture appears to be a complicated process, especially due\\nto its organizational complexity. In any case, the case studies have shown that a static assessment in the\\nform of a checklist does not work, because it often involves a lengthy process in which a full Data Mesh\\nwith all its principles and building blocks can often not be implemented in the first instance. In contrast,\\nit is merely an iterative process, in which a Data Mesh is formed within an organization, building block\\nby block, over a time-span of several years. The purpose of a readiness assessment is therefore mainly\\nidentified in these case studies as a guideline for structuring and organizing the process as a whole, and\\nfor forming insights into the organization’s strengths and weaknesses in relation to the migration. With\\nregard to the last readiness phase, namely that of a complete set of Data Mesh forces, it has turned\\nout that a complete assembly of these forces hardly occurs in practice. This representation within the\\nDMRM should therefore mainly serve as direction and an example of the principles of a Data Mesh to\\nbe implemented, without these all having to be crossed off at once.\\n5.6 contextual analysis\\nThe case studies in this study were conducted in organizations with experience with Data Mesh architec-\\ntures, as well as organizations without this experience. The organizations with experience then had these\\nto varying degrees: there were organizations that consisted of consultants who help other organizations\\nwith a Data Mesh migration, as well as organizations that have tried to implement a migration internally.\\nAlthough the number of organizations studied must be much larger to draw a more reliable conclusion\\nabout the contextual influences on Data Mesh Readiness, tentative conclusions can be drawn from the\\nanalysis in this study.\\nFirst, organizations without knowledge or experience with Data Mesh architectures seem to be a lot more\\ncritical of the concept than organizations that do have this knowledge. They quickly compare the concept\\nto a compilation of existing technological aspects and question the impact of the innovation. One reason\\nfor this could be that these organizations do not yet have the experience because, for example, they have\\nnot yet felt the need for a Data Mesh architecture, or because they have not come into contact with\\nit because they have found alternative solutions for the existing needs. In addition, it is more difficult\\nfor these organizations to use the DMRM, because the lack of experience can occasionally ensure that\\nthe terminology associated with the Data Mesh topic is not yet fully understood by the organization,\\ncausing the interpretation of some factors may differ. One way to solve this is, for example, by adding\\nmore and clearer follow-up questions to the description of the factor in the model.\\nSecond, organizations that consult other organizations in a migration to a Data Mesh architecture seem\\nto be more critical of the degree of readiness for migration. This may be because the revenue model\\nof these organizations consists of presenting a complete plan for the migration, while some case studies\\nhave shown that a Data Mesh migration is an iterative and lengthy process, emerging and developing', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 75}),\n",

It may therefore be more difficult to come up with a complete plan\\nof action in one go, showing complete readiness for a Data Mesh architecture.\\nThird, organizations that are more traditional and less data mature seem to score worse on Data Mesh\\nReadiness. This could be explained by the fact that they, for example, do not yet feel the bottlenecks\\nin the data platforms, or are simply not yet data-driven enough to start with a Data Mesh migration.\\nFor these organizations, it may be too early to think about Data Mesh readiness, and the priority is\\ncurrently starting to increase the smaller digital efforts instead of changing the entire organizational\\narchitecture.\\n5.7 chapter conclusion\\nThis chapter presented an overview of the demonstrations performed and provided different perspectives\\non the performance and the content of the DMRM. The results from the theoretical and empirical design\\nof the DMRM were used to gain insights from the practical application environment. This chapter\\naimed to provide different perspectives, which have showed that there are mahy different ways in which\\norganizations approach the migration to a Data Mesh architecture. When it comes to determining the\\nreadiness for a Data Mesh migration, the DMRM offers guidance in assessing the as-is situation of\\norganizations, and aims to provide new and clear insights to these organizations. Because the conduct of\\nthe case study is supervised by the researcher, when assessing the readiness factors, follow-up questions\\nwere asked that make it easier for the organizations to arrive at these insights. The cross-case analysis\\nhas shown that the perceived degree of readiness among organizations depends on the context in which\\nthey are located. For example, more data-driven organizations are generally more aware of their position\\ntowards Data Mesh migration, and organizations with no experience at all with Data Mesh architectures\\nare more critical of the concept than organizations that do have this experience. In addition, it appears\\nthat generic background knowledge about the functioning of a Data Mesh architecture is required to be\\nable to use a large part of the model, because this is based on knowledge about the terminology within\\nthe topic.

The organization within this test case is a traditional\\norganization with a large and fairly centralized IT department with limited organizational power to make\\nreal changes, but enough power to maintain ownership over many of the systems. Each enterprise\\noperates significant sub-businesses in the business as large domains with quite some autonomy for their\\nown business solutions, with central governance. Within the organization, software engineering skills\\nare necessary for data analysis within IT. The organization has more than 15,000 employees. When\\nassessing the need for a Data Mesh architecture, the organization mainly agreed with the need for more\\nautonomy for the domains and the need for more domain understanding. The needs that were less\\npresent in the organization were assessed sufficiently, and the assessor indicated after the assessment\\nthat the sub-questions helped to assess the as-is situation of the organization. The needs assessment\\nalso unconsciously gave direction to determining the areas from which the organization wants and can\\nderive value. Regarding the assessment of the ability to decentralize and decouple, it was clear from the\\nassessment that the participant tried extensively and in detail to answer the question. The first efforts to\\ndecentralize and decouple are there, but it still turns out to be a complicated process. After the test, the\\nparticipant indicated that answering the questions within these topics helped a lot in recalling the current\\nsituation and possible approaches to improve it. The participant gained a clear picture of the needs for\\ndecentralization, by means of giving specific and concrete answers to the questions. The assessor stated\\nthat although they already gained some idea of what would be needed within the organization for a Data\\nMesh migration, assessing the preparedness of the organization towards a Data Mesh migration was\\nhelpful in creating insights. Although not all factors were present in the organization yet, the assessor\\nindicated for some factors they would form a good approach to integrate the factor into the organization.\\nFor the factors that were not present, the assessor was able to clearly indicate why they were not yet\\nthere, even without the presence of the researcher to guide these questions.

A full description of Test Case 2 can be\\nfound in Appendix G table G.2.\\n6.1.3 Testcase 3\\nWithout Data Mesh experience — with presence of the researcher\\nThe third test case was conducted with an organization with no experience with Data Mesh architectures,\\nand also with no intention of migrating to a Data Mesh architecture. The organization is, compared\\nto the other testcases, a smaller organization with less than 1,000 employees, with a centralized data\\nplatform. An initial prognosis showed that the organization itself still processed too little data to be\\nable to come into contact with the concept of Data Mesh architectures. This image also emerged\\nduring the assessment of the need. The organization could identify with only a few needs, but especially\\ndid not experience the needs surrounding a shortage of scalability and major bottlenecks. During the\\nassessment, it emerged that there were no problems with shortcomings of the central data platform\\nwithin this organization, and that this platform was still able to meet the requirements well. During the\\nproblem identification, it was therefore found that it was not necessary to continue the assessment to\\nthe next step in the readiness chain. What has become apparent from this test case is that it is not\\nnecessarily necessary to have a researcher present for the assessment. The follow-up questions and the\\nfactor descriptions make it clear which factors are tested and the participant only needs to formulate\\nanswers to the questions. During the assessment, the participant’s suspicions were confirmed, because\\nthere was indeed no need for a migration to a Data Mesh architecture. Assessing the ability to change,\\ndespite the lack of the need for a Data Mesh architecture, did provide some insights into areas within the\\norganization for improvement. Factors specifically targeting the readiness for a Data Mesh architecture\\nwere not relevant for the organization to answer.

A factor here is that the participant had already thought about many of\\nthe assessment questions himself for a long time and therefore had already\\nprepared a large part of the answers.

Going\\nthrough the assessment was difficult for certain factors, because the participant\\nhad not yet thought about it.\\nGeneral outcome : this test case has shown that in the absence of a clear problem\\nidentification, it is not necessary to complete the assessment in its entirety.\\nBecause it was still unclear to this organization whether a Data Mesh architecture\\nwould offer the solution to their problems, the first step of the assessment could\\nnot be completed in its entirety. It is recommended to discontinue the assessment\\nin such cases and to resume it (in an iterative manner) as soon as a clear choice\\ncan be made towards a Data Mesh migration.\\n6.2 chapter conclusion\\nChapter 6 presented the results for the testing phase of this research. The model was operationalized\\nby designing a readiness assessment questionnaire, formed through the formulation of factor-specific\\nfollow-up questions that guide the self-assessment of the model. This operationalized self-assessment\\ncan be used by organizations to determine and track progress in their process prior to their Data Mesh\\nmigration. This phase tests the gained insights from the design and development phase by means of an\\noperationalized artifact in three different practical contexts. In conclusion, it can be stated that when\\nusing the operationalized readiness assessment, the results of the assessment do not depend on the\\npresence of the researcher. What does influence the results of the readiness assessment is the degree of\\nexperience with Data Mesh architectures. Although organizations with little experience within the Data\\nMesh topic, in addition to a basic background knowledge about the concept, can conduct the readiness\\nassessment using the follow-up questions, it strongly depends on the presence of the Data Mesh needs\\nwhether the assessment is useful for an organization or not.

Since this\\nresearch was conducted following the DSR research methodology, the presented conclusions serve as\\ncontributions to the existing body of knowledge on Data Mesh architectures (Hevner, 2010).\\nThe aim of this study was to develop a Data Mesh Readiness Model (DMRM) that would guide orga-\\nnizations in the process of determining their readiness towards migrating to a Data Mesh architecture.\\nThe results presented in previous chapters are discussed in this chapter to provide an overview and\\nfurther explanation of these results. This chapter presents the main findings of this research, as well\\nas the limitations of the study, the contributions of the study to the existing knowledge base, and\\nrecommendations for further research within the topic of Data Mesh architectures.\\nIn order to build the required theoretical background knowledge on Data Mesh architectures, chapter 2\\npresents a description of the design of Data Mesh architectures based on its core principles. This design\\nis visualized by a reference architecture of a Data Mesh architecture design at the end of chapter 2.\\nThese research activities serve as an answer to the first sub-question: ”What are the characteristics of\\na Data Mesh architecture?” .\\nThis research introduced a Data Mesh Readiness Model for assessing the factors influencing Data Mesh\\nreadiness of organizations. A comprehensive assessment model was developed that could be utilized\\nby organizations before and during their Data Mesh migration. The DMRM is used to determine the\\nas-is state of organizations relative to their current readiness level and their desired state of readiness,\\nby assessing the organizational and technological requirements needed to successfully engage in a Data\\nMesh migration. Subsequently, the gap between the as-is state and the desired state of Data Mesh\\nreadiness can be analyzed, on the basis of which an improvement path can be formulated.\\nThe building blocks of the first version of the model were synthesized from a literature research and\\nexploratory interviews, aiming at the identification of organizational factors that influence Data Mesh\\nreadiness. This complete set of influencing factors, as shown in table 3.2, provides an answer to the\\nsecond research-question: ”What are the factors that influence readiness for migrating to a Data Mesh\\narchitecture?” .\\nIn order to determine the structure of the model, the socio-technical complex nature of a Data Mesh\\nmigration has been taken into account: to determine Data Mesh readiness, both the technological\\nand organizational dimensions of an organization have to be assessed. Due to this fact, a new kind\\nof two-dimensional readiness model has been designed, which assesses technological factors within\\neach step through organizational steps towards readiness. For the design of this structure, both the\\nTOGAF Business Transformation Readiness Assessment (TOGAF, 2018), as well existing studies on\\norganizational change were used. The combination of these existing studies also provide an answer\\nto sub-question 3: ”Which readiness assessments with regard to IT architecture transformation are\\nprovided in literature?” .\\nAfter mapping the identified factors onto this structure, the initial DMRM emerged. This model was\\nfurther developed and refined through subject-matter expert refinement sessions and a Data Mesh\\nexpert group session. Because the path to a Data Mesh architecture for organizations is often unclear\\n73', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 83}),\n",

Subsequently, these activities resulted in the Data Mesh Readiness Model (DMRM),\\nas shown in figure 8.1. The combination of the aforementioned research activities add up to an answer\\nto sub-question 4: ”How to design a model that guides organizations through assessing their readiness\\nfor migration to a Data Mesh architecture?” .\\nIn order to demonstrate, test and evaluate the DMRM in practice, the model has been operationalized\\nfor practical use by formulating follow-up questions for the assessment of the specific factors in the\\nmodel. These factor descriptions can be found in chapter 4, and provide an answer to sub-question 5:\\n”How can the readiness model be operationalized for practical use?” .\\nIn the following research activities, the model was demonstrated in the context of seven case studies, in\\norder to gather the functioning and insights of the DMRM in practice. Moreover, these demonstrations\\nallowed for insights into the created knowledge base on Data Mesh readiness within an application\\nenvironment. The model was then tested over a number of test cases, in order to determine the\\ninfluence of the presence of the researcher and existing Data Mesh experience on the outcome of the\\nmodel. Finally, the model was evaluated with five different participants, in order to determine the\\nusability, comprehensibility and validity of the model. The results from the testing and evaluating\\nresearch activities combined serve as answer to the last sub-question of this research: ”Is the designed\\nreadiness model and readiness assessment instrument applicable in practice?” . The shared opinion of\\nthe participants on characteristics was positive.

Because this design encompasses a new way of assessing readiness, the novel structure of the\\nmodel could also be extended in the future to assess readiness towards a variety of other organizational\\ntransformations.\\nSince current research lacks a suitable Data Mesh readiness framework, organizations are currently un-\\nable to assess their readiness towards a Data Mesh migration. This makes it difficult for them to make\\na well-considered choice on when and how to transition (I. A. Machado et al., 2022b). This research\\naddresses the current research gap by providing a Data Mesh readiness framework, which enables organi-\\nzations to identify factors that influence their readiness towards Data Mesh migration and guides them\\nthrough the process of assessing this readiness.\\nMoreover, due to the novel character of the concept of Data Mesh architectures, this research has laid an\\nempirical foundation for the hitherto missing research on Data Mesh architectures, by acquiring empirical\\ndata among different contexts. This empirical foundation can fuel more scientific research on Data Mesh\\narchitectures in the future.\\nIn conclusion, the DMRM provides a unique approach to assessing readiness towards Data Mesh migra-\\ntions. Concurrently, this model broadens the knowledge base on readiness models that could be used in\\nthe domain of Data Mesh architectures.\\n8.2 practical contributions\\nThe main practical contribution lies in the design and development of a usable DMRM and associated\\nassessment, which can also be used as a self-assessment by organizations apart from the presence of\\nthe researcher. The assessment thus offers new insights for customers of the assessment and can also\\nguide them in an iterative way through the process of preparing for a Data Mesh architecture, as well\\nas its implementation. Because the context in which the model and assessment were designed and\\ndeveloped differed within organizations based on degree of Data Mesh experience and progress, the\\npractical contribution for these groups is different:\\nFirst, for organizations with a clear experience with Data Mesh organizations and an intention to embark\\non a Data Mesh migration, the DMRM provides a useful guideline for identifying needs and structuring\\nthe preparation process. The assessment can be used to assess the as-is situation and identify areas for\\nimprovement. With this it can give the organizations new insights and thus act as a roadmap within the\\ntrajectory towards migration to a Data Mesh architecture.\\nSecond, for organizations without a Data Mesh experience and with no intention to start a migration,\\nthe model can help identify shortcomings of the current data architecture, and provide inspiration for\\npossible future strategies. It is not necessary to go through the entire model, but parts of the model can\\nbe borrowed to build a custom-build future strategy in the field of data architectures. In addition, these\\norganizations can also gain insights from the assessment in the field of improving the data maturity of\\nthe organization and a tactic for stimulating data drive.\\nThe DMRM contributes in a more effective and organized way of preparing for a major organizational\\nchange. For example, it makes organizations consider how they can prepare their employees for the new\\nway of working, but it also evaluates their own data maturity against new technological applications\\nwithin the Data Mesh. The model also considers the implications of a Data Mesh migration, helping\\norganizations assess their needs and determine whether a Data Mesh architecture is the right solution\\nfor them. This allows practitioners of the model in a specific sense to assess the bottlenecks and value\\nof data architecture solutions within their own organizational context.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

LIMITATIONS 76\\n8.3 limitations\\nIn order to better understand the value of the results of the study while identifying possible directions\\nfor further research, the limitations of this study are presented below.\\n8.3.1 Design Science Research\\nBecause the Design Science Research approach was chosen in this research, one of the limitations is the\\navailability of resources for building the model. Because there was little theoretical and empirical foun-\\ndation within the subject, it was decided to extend the theoretical research with exploratory interviews.\\nA choice of participants was made based on their availability, and a different configuration of exploratory\\ninterview participants could have resulted in a different theoretical set-up of the model. Second, when\\nselecting case studies within the model, no overall adequate set of use cases was found within which the\\nmodel could be applied. Because assessing the readiness of an organization is very context dependent, a\\ndifferent use case within an unrepresented context could provide different results. In addition, the inter-\\nviews and case studies were semi-structured, leaving room for the participants’ own interpretation. As a\\nresult, the collection of the empirical data has depended on their perspectives and interpretations, and\\nit is possible that different interviewees identified different factors with different interpretations.\\n8.3.2 Innovation enthusiasm\\nBecause many of the participants of this study were found through internet search terms, word of mouth,\\nor the Data Mesh Learning Slack community, the vast majority were found through the publications of\\ntheir own articles on the topic and are thus excited about new developments and innovations. Therefore,\\nit was harder than expected to find an objective set of participants that had a critical attitude towards\\nData Mesh architectures. Through the course of actions, this innovation enthusiasm bias is kept as small\\nas possible by leaving a lot of room for criticism during the interviews and by adopting a critical attitude\\ntowards the topic. In addition, the participants in this study were not only selected based on different\\nsectors, backgrounds and roles within the organization, but also based on their current experience with\\nData Mesh architectures. In this way, efforts have been made to find a representative est of objective\\nattitudes towards the topic of this research.\\n8.3.3 Theoretical saturation\\nDue to the highly exploratory nature of this research, the main aim was to create a new theory within\\nthe Data Mesh topic, based on empirical insights. Because the generalization of existing theory was\\nnot feasible, a rich description and consensus of these empirical insights was sought throughout the\\nresearch. The quality of this research can be supported by looking for a certain degree of theoretical\\nsaturation, which means that an extra observation, interview or focus group no longer yields extra\\ninsights with regard to the subject of the research (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). During the research,\\nthis theoretical saturation was sought by strengthening the empirical foundation with 13 exploratory\\ninterviews, 4 individual refinement sessions, one evaluation session with 26 experts, 7 case studies, 3 test\\ncases and 5 evaluation sessions. Progressing through this empirical foundation, it turned out that the\\nstudy was getting closer to a point of theoretical saturation. Due to the novelty of the subject of Data\\nMesh architectures, it is unrealistic to assume full theoretical saturation after this research. During the\\nresearch process, attempts were made to continuously evaluate and refine new additions to the model,\\nin order to increase the completeness of the model. However, it is very difficult to give a complete\\nrepresentation of reality within a new topic such as this one. Certainly because this research is largely\\nbased on empirical evidence, it is quite possible that the readiness steps and the factors in the model are\\nnot an exhaustive set of readiness factors.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH 77\\niterative evaluation and refinement rounds could increase the completeness of research within the Data\\nMesh topic in the future.\\n8.4 recommendations for future research\\nFirst, the model in this study has been demonstrated in a number of different environments. Since\\nthe exploratory interviews and the case studies have shown that the readiness of organizations depends\\non contextual influences, it would be of added value to apply the model in more different contexts.\\nInvolving more different use cases could contribute to a broadened understanding of the readiness of\\norganizations towards Data Mesh migration and how the influencing factors relate to it. For example,\\nan application within a risk-averse and heavily government-regulated sector such as healthcare could\\nprovide interesting insights. The contexts within this research were often less regulated and more\\ndata-driven.\\nSecond, an empirical follow-up study could focus more on recruiting more critical participants in the\\nstudy. Because the topic is currently very popular among data-driven enthusiasts, it was difficult to\\nfind participants who could express themselves critically towards the topic and who also had empirical\\nevidence for this. Follow-up research could take place in the future if there are more practical examples\\nof Data Mesh implementations and their critics.\\nThird, follow-up research could focus on the factors that had little consensus during the case studies,\\nsuch as establishing an appropriate governance model for Data Mesh architectures or addressing the\\ndecentralization and decoupling process. While this study has provided an overview of the as-is situation\\nof participating organizations and offered different perspectives, follow-up research can delve deeper\\ninto these topics and explore the best ways to address these factors. For example, a Design Science\\nResearch into the design and development of a Data Mesh governance model could be of added value.\\nFourth, follow-up research could focus on designing and developing an execution framework for imple-\\nmenting a Data Mesh architecture. While this research mainly focused on readiness and preparation\\nprior to implementation, follow-up research can take a look at an actual implementation process of a\\nData Mesh architecture. Specific attention could be paid to certain implementation challenges that\\nflow from the readiness assessment, or tackling the identified areas of improvement in a practical sense.\\nFinally, more research on the societal and organizational impact caused by the implementation of a Data\\nMesh architecture is proposed. Because of the novelty of the subject and the socio-technical context in\\nwhich it takes place, it is of great value to know what the specific societal and organizational changes\\nare that are involved in the large-scale implementation of Data Mesh architectures. This research can\\nprovide more insight for organizations to assess whether they are suitable for this architecture design and\\nthen also provide insights into the future vision of distributed architecture designs and the impact it has\\non society as a whole.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='9 R E F L E C T I O N\\n9.1 reflection on the process\\nFirst, I will reflect on the process leading me to the outcomes of this research. I believe that the choice\\nfor the Design Science Research approach was the right one, since it appears to be most suitable for\\nan exploratory research like this one. I enjoyed researching the topic of Data Mesh architectures very\\nmuch, since it gave me the opportunity to speak with a lot of experts from all around the world. The\\ninsights they’ve given me and the lessons I’ve learned from them give me an additional knowledge that\\nI can carry with me for the upcoming years. As for the things I would do differently, if I were to redo\\nthis research, I would come to the following four points.\\n•First, I would take more time in the first few weeks to define the research problem and the facets\\naround it. Out of enthusiasm I immediately started determining the necessary literature, interviews,\\nand other matters. It might have been better to scope the problem clearly from the start so that\\nI didn’t have to spend more time on this later.\\n•Second, I would be more critical of the information that I would include in the research. I noticed\\nthat - especially due to the lack of literature that focuses specifically on the Data Mesh architecture\\n- I occasionally got lost in information. I found it difficult to determine whether it was relevant\\nor not, so I tried to include it all. In retrospect, I think it’s more valuable to be critical of the\\ninformation you send yourself during the investigation from the start, and it’s best to make choices\\nfrom the start.\\n•Third, I would also be more selective about the amount of empirical data I needed for my interview.\\nBecause I was completely taken in by the interviews, the interesting people, and the rich insights\\nthey gave me, in retrospect I may have involved too many people in my research. This meant that\\nI was too often working late at night to process and analyze all this empirical data. Keeping in\\nmind the theoretical saturation I was looking for, it may not have been necessary to speak to more\\npeople from the same quarter: however interesting and fun it was to get to know all these people.\\n•Fourth, I’ve noticed that I’m good at conducting research on my own, but maybe too well.\\nBecause of my partnership with Deloitte Consulting and the resources they had to offer me, I\\nthink in hindsight I could and should have made more use of it. It now took me a lot longer to\\ngather all my information from outside Deloitte, when it might have been easier to occasionally\\nlook for it internally. I noticed that I was afraid that my research would become too biased if I\\nonly got information from Deloitte, but in retrospect I should have been a little less critical about\\nthis.\\nFinally, what I found most difficult in this research was finding a consensus among all the people involved\\nin my research. Due to the highly exploratory nature of my research, I had to deal with a lot of empirical\\ndata on a completely new topic. This gave me many different perspectives, and it was sometimes a long\\nsearch for a consensus or common thread in all these perspectives. This made it difficult to conceptualize\\nthe factors into an overarching idea, and to make a synthesis that was useful for my research. This meant\\nthat I often spent a long time looking for a conclusion, or that I had to contact my interview participants\\nagain to explain certain ideas. Again, this took a lot of time, and I hope I learned enough from this to\\nbe able to do this more efficiently in the future. Overall, I’m happy with the process of the research, and\\nI’ve learned an incredible amount from it.\\n78', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='9.2. REFLECTION ON THE FINDINGS 79\\n9.2 reflection on the findings\\nFor the reflection on the findings of this study, I discuss the main and most striking results of this\\nstudy. I will discuss these results on the basis of the various components of the model. First, when it\\ncomes to assessing the Need for a Data Mesh architecture, it has been found that it is more difficult\\nthan expected to identify this specific need for organizations that have not yet thought of a Data Mesh\\nsolution. Many organizations are not yet data mature enough to know all the ins and outs of the overall\\nfunctioning of their data architecture, which makes identifying specific bottlenecks and focus areas\\ncomplicated. The main need pointing to a Data Mesh turned out to be the need to bring the analytic\\nand operational side of the data platform together, so that there is more awareness among these people\\nof the specific responsibilities they bear. Consequently, this would allow for more efficient and improved\\ncollaboration, which can exist with fewer dependencies. In addition, a need for improved scalability is a\\nclear need that can be addressed by a Data Mesh architecture.\\nWith regard to the ability to migrate to a Data Mesh, the biggest challenge for organizations is to\\nbe able to decompose their monolith in domain teams, and this is also a very important factor in\\ndetermining readiness. Organizations that fail to gain readiness towards a Data Mesh architecture often\\nfail to identify decentralized teams. There are several ways to deal with this decomposition, but it is\\ncertain that a lot of attention should be paid to it.\\nWith regard to the preparedness for a Data Mesh architecture, the importance of a clear division of\\nroles and responsibilities emerged. This is often underestimated by organizations - also by organizations\\nthat already have a higher readiness level - and it is therefore often a point where organizations still\\nhave to implement improvements afterwards. Overall, this research has shown that achieving Data Mesh\\nreadiness requires organizations to map out a lengthy and costly process. As a researcher, I have a\\ncritical position in this: I don’t think a Data Mesh architecture is suitable for all organizations, and I\\nam afraid that organizations will start the process without being suitable for it. I have seen that a Data\\nMesh architecture mainly offers a solution for large and complex organizations that are digital native,\\nhave an established Agile way of working and have a clear innovation culture incorporated. And while I\\ncan imagine that there are a lot of organizations that want to become more data-driven in the future,\\nI also believe that for many of these organizations there are cheaper and less complex ways to address\\nthis need.\\n9.3 reflection on the dmrm\\nRegarding the reflection on the DMRM, one of the main insights has to do with the intended iterative use\\nof the model. While most readiness assessments are static checklists that give some sort of quantifiable\\nresult after completion, that is not the case with this model. Accordingly, during the design &\\ndevelopment process, it turned out to be unrealistic to attach a quantitative outcome to an assessment,\\nbecause the way in which the assessment is expressed depends very much on the organization in question.\\nWhere one organization faces major problems in the division of roles and tasks, the other organization\\nwill experience more problems with the central Business & IT alignment. For the first organization in\\nquestion, it is therefore more relevant to pay attention to a renewed appointment of roles, while the sec-\\nond organization attaches more value to achieving data awareness among all teams in the organization.\\nThis insight also underlines the iterative nature of the instrument: because a Data Mesh migration takes\\nplace over several years in a constantly changing environment, it is very important to frequently assess\\nthe performance towards readiness. A Data Mesh migration is a complex and organization-wide trans-\\nformation that requires structure and guidance. The DMRM seeks to provide this guidance by assessing\\nkey organizational factors and offering insights into the organization’s position in relation to these factors.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 89}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='9.3. REFLECTION ON THE DMRM 80\\nFinally, I would like to add one more critical note to the DMRM. The topic of Data Mesh is currently very\\npopular, and organizations are trying from all directions to achieve the ’perfect’ Data Mesh. Although\\nthe opinions among the participants of this study differ about the extent to which an organization should\\nimplement all principles in detail, I think it is important as an organization to attain a critical attitude\\ntowards this. Perhaps you as an organization do not need all components, if a partial Data Mesh could\\nserve as the solution for your needs. The DMRM supports organizations in this by leaving it up to\\nthe organizations themselves which factors and components of the model are relevant to them. During\\nthe assessment it will become clear which improvement areas will be discussed, and it is up to the\\norganizations themselves to determine whether they want to tackle all these improvement areas. I think\\nthat the ideas surrounding the Data Mesh architecture, and the purpose that this new design of data\\narchitecture has, will prove valuable in the future. But for now it is important not to blindly adopt such\\nideas, but to position yourself as an organization within the hype and to only incorporate the principles\\nthat could be of value.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

The recommenda-\\ntions are based on the best practices and insights of all participants of this research.\\na.1 recommendations on the assessment results\\nRecommendations regarding Willingness to Change\\nOrganizations that score low on the Willingness to Change dimension can improve themselves by\\nstarting with a clear understanding of the concept of Data Mesh and the value it brings to the entire\\norganization. This understanding is supported by a supportive culture in the field of learning and\\ninnovation. This culture can be fostered by, for example, setting up extensive R&D teams, facilitating\\ndata literacy workshops in the organization, making data awareness training accessible to everyone and\\nupskilling the domain teams so that they can create and maintain data products in the future. Ensure\\nwithin the organization an appetite for organizational change, and leverage the right people who have\\nthe right influence throughout this process.\\nRecommendations regarding Vision\\nIn the absence of a clear vision towards a Data Mesh architecture, it is could be useful to start with\\nan appropriate data strategy for the organization. Within this strategy, tactical objectives and strategic\\nobjectives can be formulated. In addition, it is recommended to map out where redundant work is\\ncurrently being performed. Organizations that want to become data-driven ultimately want to base\\ntheir decision-making on facts and insights from the data. A marketplace of data could be established\\nwithin the organization, where people can find and use data for these insights. In addition, it can be\\nuseful to measure the demand for value creation from different perspectives within the organization.\\nNot only the business side of the organization should be involved, but also the operational teams. These\\nteams should attain a focus on the consumers of their data, and the value they deliver to these consumers.\\nRecommendations regarding Business Case\\nIn the absence of a clear Business & IT alignment, it is useful to reflect on when mapping the\\norganization around each other’s operations and values of the data. It is not recommended to look\\nin a customer supply relationship between business and IT, but to change the perception towards an\\nexpectation-based relationship. What do the teams expect from each other, and how do they support\\neach other? In this way, the operational teams can gain a better insight into what they contribute to\\nbusiness-wise. The alignment can also be found in improved collaboration, so that common interest in\\ndata can arise through improved data awareness. Programs as formulated in the objectives support this\\nawareness. These programs can be initiated by the business users who want to become more actively\\ninvolved in the processing of data.\\nRecommendations regarding Top-Management Engagement\\nIn the absence of top-management engagement, an improved value statement of the Data Mesh\\nmigration for these executives can be looked into. Top-management support is recommended for an\\norganization-wide migration, because they can translate the ambition across the entire organization.\\nAdditionally, their motivations and directions should be aligned with the focus areas of a Data Mesh\\n89', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='A.1. RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS 90\\narchitecture. The focus areas of a Data Mesh lie in developing an architecture that is easy to evolve\\nand access, and to better accommodate large amounts of data. Where there is a need for improved\\nmanagement of the complexity of the domains, a Data Mesh architecture can contribute to improving\\nthe understanding and trustworthiness of the data. Workshops or written value statements that\\nshowcase or describe these contributions can help create support among top management.\\nRecommendations regarding Enterprise Ability\\nWith deficiencies in the enterprise ability to migrate, it is recommended to realize that decentralizing\\nand decoupling current monolithic structures is a lengthy and iterative process. Recommendations\\nwithin this process are, for example, to start identifying the domains, and to consider how these\\ndomains can be enabled to work autonomously. Not all domains have the capability to work\\nautonomously, so it is recommended to start slowly with the domains that are the most mature\\nand eager to be autonomous. These domains can serve as an example and pilot study. Outlining\\nthe business domains on a map can help with the decentralization process, for example based on\\nexisting domains that already own business artifacts or based on each vice president within the orga-\\nnization. The ownership boundaries are formulated so that the domains do not step on each other’s toes.\\nIn line with this, it is useful to realize that not every organization is able to decouple the central platforms.\\nFor these organizations, a logical split in the domains can be chosen, whereby each part of the central\\napplication belongs to one domain. Perform a translation which allows to decouple the operational plane\\nfrom the analytical plan in this application, so that an abstraction layer is created between business\\napplication and analytical application.\\nFinally, the ability to work in domain teams can be increased by looking closely at the demand or data\\nengineering skills in each domain. Not all domains have a constant workload over time, so at the\\nbeginning of the migration it is possible to work with, for example, a center of excellence of a pool of\\npeople who are able to jump into domain problems. It is recommended to retain a certain amount of\\ndomain knowledge within the data engineers. In addition, a migration program could be established that\\nredesigns the entire organization based on domains and processes around the domains. This program is\\ncarried across the organization as a whole and ensures that the most important concepts - such as the\\ndefinition of a data product, how you publish, how you manage data - are clear and understandable to\\nthe people who become part of a domain.\\nRecommendations regarding Clearly defined Roles and Responsibilities\\nFirstly, if there is a shortcoming within this dimension, it is recommended to realize that not everything\\nhas to be perfectly defined, but that there is a clear ownership alignment among the domains and\\nthe organization as a whole. A data product manager in any domain should have the information\\nwhat the data product means, and know and understand the data product. This improves trust in\\ndata products between the different domains. Certain roles that could be divided in this context\\nare, for example, those of a data owner in terms of business insights, a data custodian in terms of\\nIT responsibilities and a data steward as data product manager and to bridge the gap between both teams.\\nRecommendations regarding Governance\\nIt has become clear from this study that few recommendations can be made in the field of setting up\\nthe governance model correctly. Recommendations were to focus on making it easy to share and access\\ndata within the Data Mesh architecture, within the regulatory boundaries. Automation and tools help\\nwith this, but are not necessary. In addition, a central governance body is needed that can enforce\\nthe organization-wide standards and rules across the domains. Within the domains, governance must\\nensure that the data is correctly defined and placed within the correct business context. Possibilities for\\nrealizing democratized governance are, for example, with a governance forum in which the domains can\\nprovide input and be part of the decision-making process. Formal governance can be made available on\\nthis forum so that certain policies are discoverable. From the technology perspective, components can', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='A.1. RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS 91\\nbe built into the platform that can apply certain automated rules and policies.\\nRecommendations regarding Workable Approach\\nIf there is a shortcoming within the workable approach dimension, the needs of the cross-domain collab-\\noration could be looked at with regard to communication and collaboration. This can be done through\\ndata exchange, recurring meetings or collaboration agreements. With many inter-domain dependencies,\\ndata contracts or service level agreements can be drawn up to improve reliability. It is also possible to\\nlook at a place in the organization, physical or digital, where this inner- and cross-domain collaboration\\ncan take place.\\nWith regard to data literacy, it depends on the choice of technology within the organization. With more\\ncomplex technology choices, it is more important to have a greater degree of data literacy. You can also\\nopt for more modern tools that do not require data engineers. Data literacy can be improved through a\\nknowledge sharing platform, data literacy workshops or data awareness programs.\\nRecommendations regarding IT Capacity\\nIn case of shortcomings in IT capacity, it is recommended to prioritize. Where continuous integration\\nand automation standards have not been applied, it does not have the highest priority to develop\\nthem. Continuous deployment is more important when it comes to managing multiple data products.\\nIn addition, it is possible to look at developing approaches that counteract breaking use cases for\\ndownstream users, in case of changes to existing datasets. In addition, it is also up to the domains\\nthemselves to determine with which maturity in terms of CI/CD and automation they want to work\\non their inner-domain processes. Important to start with are data product publication standards. If\\nthey don’t exist yet, they should be set up to structure this process. These standards contain, for\\nexample, APIs for the structure of data, data contracts for the trust in the data, a description of the\\ndata so that consumers can use the data, or a technology standard with which data products can be built.\\nRecommendations regarding Enterprise Capacity\\nIn case of shortcomings in the Enterprise Capacity dimension, it is recommended to start by recording the\\nnew team structures. A certain alignment with the business domains is suggested, because in this way\\nbusiness domain knowledge can be preserved within the Data Mesh domains. For example, this domain\\nknowledge can come in useful when feeling the responsibility about the domains, and it can be easier\\nto feel this responsibility if it already existed for a certain part of the business. In addition, this way of\\nstructuring ensures that the Data Mesh domains are not placed too far from the business.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 101}),\n",

Moreover, several Data Mesh initiatives such as the ’Data Mesh Podcast’ and\\n’Data Mesh Knowledge Exchange Platform’ were used to get in contact with experts from the field.\\nThe selection criteria for incorporating interviewees within this research was based on providing IT/data\\nservices, current way of working, Data Mesh implementation intention, and availability.

Empirical data is retrieved with\\nusing qualitative research, and the theoretical model of this research is through these interviews further\\ndeveloped towards a theoretically and empirically-based Data Mesh readiness assessment model. The\\ntheoretical model gave a clear overview of the generic readiness assessment model, and the practical\\ndata enriches this model with a larger focus on the best practices from the practical world.\\nEach interview took approximately an hour and was done via online meetings. All interviews were\\nassessed in English since this made the transcription process of the interviews easier. This transcription\\ndocument was used for qualitative analysis of the data. Summarized conclusions and quotes of the\\ninterviewees are used in the results section of this research.\\nd.5 secondary data\\nThe conducted interviews are seen as the primary data for this research. Besides this data, there is also\\nsecondary data retrieved. Most of the times, it was recommended by the interviewees to look into some\\nspecific external data. This external data is seen as secondary data in this research. The secondary\\ndata is used to complement the cases with extra insights from earlier researches, projects, papers or\\nbooks.\\nd.6 drawbacks\\nThe expert interviews have other drawbacks that are necessary to mention.

Secondly, due to time limitations and the availability of people, it was not always possible to\\nask all questions of the interview protocol to the interviewee. Moreover, some opinions were interesting\\nenough to dive deeper into, however, this was not possible due to these time restrictions. Next to\\nthat, it seemed quite hard for the interviewees to rate the factors as included in the theoretical model\\nby means of importance, due to the novelty of the topic. Most interviewees only have suggestive or\\nminor experience with implementing a data mesh architecture, and found it therefor hard to make\\nbold statements on the factors within the theoretical model. Although an attempt was made within\\nthis research to find interviewees that have already implemented a complete data mesh architecture in\\npractice, this was not possible since there weren’t any. This drawback was assessed by stating that the\\ninterviewees should indicate whether they think it would be important for them in their organization, or\\nwhether they would focus on the aspect. Most of the interviewees doubted on their answers but could\\nmake accurate estimates on whether the factor could be important when potentially implementing a\\ndata mesh architecture.', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 109}),\n",

Moreover, 95% of\\nbusinesses cite the need to manage the large and unstructured\\namount of data as a problem for their business (Kulkarni,\\n2019). As a way to solve this problem and to address the value\\nit can have for their performance, organizations have spent\\nThis footnote will be used only by the Editor and Associate Editors.

For a long\\ntime, these enterprise data architectures were built as a single\\npipeline consisting of a single data processing unit, with the\\ndata generators at the beginning of the pipeline and the data\\noperators at the end of it (Selmadji et al., 2020). This way of\\ndesigning a data architecture is referred to as a monolithic data\\narchitecture design. However, due to the increasing amount of\\ndata to be processed, the ever-growing amount of data analysis\\ntechniques, and the amount of functionalities it has to address,\\nthese monolithic architectures have shown their limitations in\\ndifferent areas such as maintenance and debugging, scalability,\\nmaintaining quality data, and ownership and responsibility\\nissues (Khazaei, Barna, Beigi-Mohammadi, & Litoiu, 2016;\\nKhazaei et al., 2016; Lawal Moshood, Ileladewa Adeoye, &\\nLawal Habibu, 2020; Saransig & Tapia Leon, 2019; Selmadji\\net al., 2020). Consequently, these limitations result in an\\noverload in the data teams in response to the growing needs\\nof the organization (Dehghani, 2022).\\nA novel approach for addressing this problem has emerged\\nas the Data Mesh architecture: a distributed domain-driven\\narchitecture design that splits the organization and associated\\ndata platforms into domains, each responsible for their own\\ndata processing. This new data architecture design promises\\nto be more scalable, as adding new data-processing business\\nunits can be done by adding a domain to the existing entity.\\nHowever, it is still unclear to many organizations whether\\nthis proposed solution can also offer a solution for them.\\nAnd if the organizations have determined that the migration\\nto a Data Mesh architecture can be beneficial for their\\nperformance, it is unclear how they should approach this\\nmigration. Implementing a Data Mesh architecture promises\\nto deliver significant benefits over other approaches, but\\nthe process itself is not as simple as implementing a new\\ntool or feature. Moreover, in order to actually deliver these\\nsignificant benefits, it is important to include all relevant\\nprocesses, structures, and regulations in the migration to a\\nData Mesh architecture. This is a very drastic and complex\\nprocess for organizations that needs to be thought through\\nvery carefully before it can be carried out (Furia, 2021;\\nSchultze, 2020).

Next, the research approach\\nfor the design and development of the Data Mesh Readiness\\nModel is presented. The paper is concluded with a general\\nrecommendation on potential results of the model, followed by\\na general conclusion on the research and directions for future\\nresearch.\\nII. DATA MESH ARCHITECTURE DESIGN\\nA Data Mesh is a domain-driven distributed architecture\\ndesign, that is all about “recognizing and identifying data\\ndomains in an organization, as well as constructing an\\narchitecture based on numerous components that make up\\nthese domains” (Hokkanen, 2021). The main objective of a\\nData Mesh is to eliminate the challenges of data availability\\nand accessibility at scale (Dehghani, 2022). The domain-\\ndriven design characteristic of a Data Mesh architecture\\ntackles issues when different business units are working on\\nlarge projects, speaking different business languages and\\nformulating different requirements for that project, as is\\nhappening in monolithic architectures (Braun, Bieniusa, &\\nElberzhager, 2021). The bounded context in a domain-driven\\ndesign defines clear boundaries for every business domain\\nin the organization, ensuring that domain experts and data\\nengineers within that domain are working closely together\\n(Braun et al., 2021). The architecture is thus consisting\\nof domain-driven components that operate interoperable and\\nindependently of each other (Enyo-one Musa, 2021). It\\nis essentially an organizational change of current enterprise\\ndata architectures, rather than a technological transformation,\\nin which the main focus lies on distributed data domain\\nteams consisting of domain-specific data engineers and\\ndata owners (Fleury, 2021). This distributed Data Mesh\\narchitecture is built upon earlier alternatives to monolithic\\narchitecture and promises a more empowered, scalable,\\nagile architecture comprising of multi-function teams and\\na domain-driven business structure, aimed to address theorganizational challenges that were neglected by earlier\\nenterprise architecture designs (Enyo-one Musa, 2021; Ray &\\nPal, 2020). Figure 1 gives a simplified representation of a Data\\nMesh architecture design.\\nFig. 1. Data Mesh Architecture Design\\nA Data Mesh is built upon four core principles, which are\\na combination of existing ideas on Distributed Architectures\\nand Domain-Driven Design (DDD) (Dehghani, 2022). These\\nprinciples are (1) Domain-Oriented Decentralised Data\\nOwnership and Architecture, (2) Data as a Product, (3) Self-\\nServe Data Infrastructure as a Platform, and (4) Federated\\nComputational Governance.\\nA. Domain-Oriented Decentralised Ownership\\nThe first principle deals with decoupling and decentralizing\\nthe traditional monolithic data platform into a distributed\\nvariant. This decentralization is domain-oriented: that is,\\nthe decentralized components of the former large whole are\\nselected on the domain they carry within the organization\\n(Goniwada, 2022). The motivation behind this idea is about\\nplacing the ownership of analytical data for business domains\\nclose to the data itself, so that the processing, managing and\\nanalysing of the data can be done independently by the domain\\nteams itself (Dehghani, 2022). The domains host and serve\\ntheir datasets in an easily consumable way, while being close\\nto the point of destination of the data (Serra, 2021).\\nB. Data as a Product\\nThe second principle deals with the way data is viewed\\nwithin the organization. Where data in the earlier data\\narchitectures was mostly considered to be a huge data\\nrepository, in a data mesh data is considered as a product that is\\nready-to-use for analytical purposes. Since the data in a Data\\nMesh becomes a prior business asset, the Product Thinking\\napproach is applied to the data in a Data Mesh (I. A. Machado,\\nCosta, & Santos, 2022). This approach sees data as a product,\\nand this product needs to have a set of certain characteristics\\nthat maintain the quality of the data and the efficiency of the\\nMesh (Dehghani, 2022). These characteristics are in scientific\\nliterature formulated as the DATSIS principles: the data must\\nbe Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-Describing,\\nInteroperable and Secure (I. Machado, Costa, & Santos, 2021).\\nC. Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform\\nIn order to enable the domain’s cross-functional teams to\\nshare their data, a self-serve platform must be built into the\\nData Mesh (Dehghani, 2022). This platform is built and\\n2', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

Federated Computational Governance\\nThe last principle deals with the construction of a\\nfederated and global governance among the Data Mesh. The\\norganizational structure of this federated governance and\\nglobal standards is challenging, but very important for the\\nfunctioning of the Data Mesh. The governance needs to set\\nglobal rules on local data practices and decisions, and consists\\nof principles underpinning the scope of the global governance.\\nMoreover, the global governance is lead by a team that\\nconsists of members of the group from the domain, the self-\\nserve platform and global compliance stewards that both have\\nglobal and local incentives. Moreover, the global decision\\nstandards contain platform capability automating the decisions\\nand computationally validating it continuously across all data\\nproducts and domains (Dehghani, 2022).\\nIII. DATA MESH BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS\\nIn order to maintain a critical view of this new innovation,\\nthe advantages and disadvantages of a Data Mesh architecture\\nhave been investigated. These advantages and disadvantages\\nare considered during the entire study, in order to stimulate\\nan objective outcome of the study. The advantages of a Data\\nMesh architecture can primarily be found in improving the\\naccessibility of the data, due to the fact that the data products\\nfrom the domains are published in a discoverable way on an\\neasily accessible platform. In addition, the domain-oriented\\ndecentralization ensures that both the operations side of the\\ndata platform as well of the analytics side work together in\\ndomain teams, which can have a positive effect on the lead\\ntimes between requests from these teams. Finally, a Data Mesh\\narchitecture advocates a clearer and more logical appointment\\nof ownership over data and its products in the organization,\\nwhich benefits the responsibility over and the quality of the\\ndata (Saurabh, 2021).\\nThe limitations of a Data Mesh architecture lie primarily\\nin a greater need for data specialists within organizations,\\nbecause each domain is responsible for its own data\\nprocessing. Solutions for this can be sought in hiring\\nmore data specialists, or upskilling the current people in the\\norganization. In addition, within a Data Mesh architecture\\nthere will always be a need for a central body in the\\norganization that monitors the governance and interoperability\\nof the cross-domain collaboration. The boundaries between\\nthe dependencies of the central team and the independencies\\nof the domains themselves can become vague (Saurabh, 2021).\\nFinally, it is very important that there is a proper alignment\\nof the interfaces of the different business domains, because\\notherwise there is a risk of unintegrated data silos in the\\ndomains. These silos can cause many copies of data to be\\nmade, which can be problematic in terms of data latency and\\ndata quality. In conclusion, a Data Mesh architecture should\\nprimarily be seen as a socio-technical approach for solvingcontemporary problems with the accessibility, management\\nand analysis of data within large and complex organizations.\\nThe organizational challenge primarily consists of changing\\nthe way of thinking, namely about data as products, and the\\nway of working, namely with a high degree of self-service\\n(Goetz, 2022). And although this is more of an organizational\\nissue than a technological issue, technology is needed that can\\nmake this possible and prevent the organizational chaos in a\\ndistributed architecture. The aim of this technology should\\nbe to support and enable the various principles of the Data\\nMesh, while complying with a well-thought-out and partially\\nfederalized governance model that enables the Data Mesh and\\nstructures and organizes its decentralized nature.\\nIV . RESEARCH APPROACH\\nThe aim of this research is to design a model that enables\\norganizations to assess their readiness for migrating to a Data\\nMesh architecture. In order to be able to grasp Data Mesh\\nreadiness within organizations, a theoretical model has been\\ndeveloped that contains factors that influence this readiness.\\nIn order to give a clear overview on influencing factors on\\nData Mesh readiness within all facets of the organization,\\nthe conceptual framework capturing Data Mesh readiness\\nshould contain a number of dimensions that address the\\norganizational facets and a number of factors that correspond\\nto these dimensions (Fraser, Moultrie, & Gregory, 2002). The\\nidentification of the components of the model can be achieved\\nby carrying out extensive literature research here (de Bruin &\\nRosemann, 2005). This literature review resulted in a list of\\ncomponents that influence organizational readiness in relation\\nto a new technology, but are not yet specifically aimed at a\\nData Mesh architecture. Due to the novelty of the subject\\nand the lack of scientific literature on the subject, the first list\\nof influencing factors has been supplemented with identified\\nfactors from thirteen exploratory interviews with Data Mesh\\nexperts. These experts identified new influencing factors on\\nData Mesh readiness as well as evaluated factors extracted\\nfrom the literature. Together, this resulted in the compilation\\nof a list of influencing factors that will form the basis of the\\nData Mesh Readiness Model.\\nSince Data Mesh readiness emerges from both the\\ntechnological dimension of the organization, as well as\\nfrom the organizational side, the Data Mesh Readiness Model\\nhas been designed upon a combination of the structures\\nof technology adaption models and organizational change\\nmodels. The two-dimensional design ensures that both the\\norganizational side as well as the technological implications\\ncan be taken into account when assessing Data Mesh\\nreadiness. The model measures the readiness in various\\norganizational steps on the horizontal axis, whereby a factor\\nwithin the associated factor dimension can be assessed within\\neach step on the vertical axis. The factor dimensions are\\nretrieved from TOGAF’s Business Transformation Readiness\\nModel (TOGAF, 2018).

THE DATA MESH READINESS MODEL\\nThere is a need for a study that investigates the factors\\nthat influence readiness for a Data Mesh migration and the\\nnecessary capabilities needed within organizations to start this\\nmigration. The Data Mesh Readiness Model addresses this\\nneed and enables organizations to test whether they are ready\\nto migrate to a Data Mesh architecture, in a multi-dimensional\\nand step wise manner. In order to elaborate on the structure\\nof the model and the model itself, the Data Mesh Readiness\\nModel is elaborated on in this section.\\nA. Description of the Structure of the Model\\nThe model is structured onto two dimensions: on the\\nhorizontal axis the model is build up in several organizational\\nsteps towards Data Mesh readiness, and on the vertical axis\\nthe model consists of several factor dimensions influencing\\nthe particular readiness steps.\\nDue to the complex nature of a Data Mesh architecture in\\nboth organizational and technological areas, the design of the\\nmodel provides structure in the long-term migration process of\\norganizations towards Data Mesh readiness.\\nIn addition, because it became apparent during the formulation\\nof the knowledge gap that it is not always clear to\\norganizations whether a Data Mesh addresses their respective\\nneeds, the first step of the model consists of problem\\nidentification that must be completed before the process is\\nstarted. If this problem identification shows that a Data Mesh\\narchitecture does not sufficiently address their needs, it is not\\nnecessary for the organization to resume the next assessment.\\nThe final step of the model covers the overall technological\\nand organizational readiness for a Data Mesh architecture,\\nbased on the structural principles of the Data Mesh concept.\\nA remark that should be made here is that it is not necessary\\nfor all organizations to implement every specific principle in\\ndetail: going through the model will show which parts of the\\norganization need more elaboration than others.\\nB. Description of the Use of the Model\\nThe model can be used by organizations to self-assess\\ntheir Data Mesh readiness, and to identify improvement\\nopportunities based on the results of the assessment. It\\ntherefore allows for organizational learning, aiming to\\nfacilitate faster decision-making regarding the presented\\nimprovement-areas of the participating organization. When\\nusing the model, it could be beneficial for organizations\\nto choose a group of diverse participants with different\\nroles within the organization. Due to the broad scoping of\\nthe model, ranging from strategical and organization-wide\\ndimensions to operational and technology implementation\\ndimensions, readiness for a Data Mesh architecture could be\\nassessed within all these different layers of the organization.\\nDue to the process and lengthy nature of a Data Mesh\\nmigration, it is recommended to use the assessment as aguideline throughout the entire process. Since it is unrealistic\\nto assume that a Data Mesh migration can be completed within\\none iteration step, the step-by-step assessment can be used\\nto assess the progression of the different steps. It is also\\npossible to use the assessment in later readiness steps to assess\\nearlier steps, to improve or distort implementations that have\\nalready been done. In other words, it is recommended to take\\nthe assessment repeatedly during the Data Mesh migration\\nprocess. In this way, the as-is state of the organization\\nand the aspired to-be state can be assessed frequently and\\nin a structured manner, so that the ambition levels that the\\norganization is seeking to achieve can be determined time and\\nagain. In this way, after each assessment, the gap between\\nthe as-is state and the desired state of the organization can be\\nanalyzed, on the basis of which an improvement path can be\\nformulated.\\nThe model should primarily be seen as an organizational\\nguideline for structuring and organizing a multi-dimensional\\nData Mesh migration, rather than as a quantifiable assessment\\ntool. The reason for this is twofold. First, a Data Mesh\\nmigration often depends on the specific organization in\\nwhich it is performed, and it is therefore difficult to give\\na standardized quantitative rating to the degree of factors\\npresent. Secondly, it is beyond the aim of the assessment to\\npresent a one-off rating: after all, this number does not provide\\nsufficient insight into the independent improvement areas and\\ncould lead to the risk of overseeing specific organizational\\nchallenges.\\nVII. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONS\\nDuring the demonstration and test phase in this research,\\nthe model was tested in practice among organizations from\\ndifferent sectors. From the empirical data obtained from\\nthese applications, recommendations can be generated that are\\nbased on the consensus about the best practices for Data Mesh\\nmigration of these organizations. These recommendations are\\npresented below.\\nA. Recommendations regarding Willingness to Change\\nOrganizations that score low on the Willingness to Change\\ndimension can improve themselves by starting with a clear\\nunderstanding of the concept of Data Mesh and the value\\nit brings to the entire organization. This understanding is\\nsupported by a supportive culture in the field of learning and\\ninnovation. This culture can be fostered by, for example,\\nsetting up extensive R&D teams, facilitating data literacy\\nworkshops in the organization, making data awareness training\\naccessible to everyone and upskilling the domain teams so\\nthat they can create and maintain data products in the future.\\nEnsure within the organization an appetite for organizational\\nchange, and leverage the right people who have the right\\ninfluence throughout this process.\\nB. Recommendations regarding Vision\\nIn the absence of a clear vision towards a Data Mesh\\narchitecture, it is could be useful to start with an appropriate\\ndata strategy for the organization. Within this strategy, tactical\\nobjectives and strategic objectives can be formulated. In\\naddition, it is recommended to map out where redundant\\n7', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 135}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='work is currently being performed. Organizations that want\\nto become data-driven ultimately want to base their decision-\\nmaking on facts and insights from the data. A marketplace\\nof data could be established within the organization, where\\npeople can find and use data for these insights. In addition, it\\ncan be useful to measure the demand for value creation from\\ndifferent perspectives within the organization. Not only the\\nbusiness side of the organization should be involved, but also\\nthe operational teams. These teams should attain a focus on\\nthe consumers of their data, and the value they deliver to these\\nconsumers.\\nC. Recommendations regarding Business Case\\nIn the absence of a clear Business & IT alignment, it is\\nuseful to reflect on when mapping the organization around\\neach other’s operations and values of the data. It is not\\nrecommended to look in a customer supply relationship\\nbetween business and IT, but to change the perception towards\\nan expectation-based relationship. What do the teams expect\\nfrom each other, and how do they support each other? In this\\nway, the operational teams can gain a better insight into what\\nthey contribute to business-wise. The alignment can also be\\nfound in improved collaboration, so that common interest in\\ndata can arise through improved data awareness. Programs\\nas formulated in the objectives support this awareness. These\\nprograms can be initiated by the business users who want to\\nbecome more actively involved in the processing of data.\\nD. Recommendations regarding Top-Management\\nEngagement\\nIn the absence of top-management engagement, an\\nimproved value statement of the Data Mesh migration for\\nthese executives can be looked into. Top-management support\\nis recommended for an organization-wide migration, because\\nthey can translate the ambition across the entire organization.\\nAdditionally, their motivations and directions should be\\naligned with the focus areas of a Data Mesh architecture. The\\nfocus areas of a Data Mesh lie in developing an architecture\\nthat is easy to evolve and access, and to better accommodate\\nlarge amounts of data. Where there is a need for improved\\nmanagement of the complexity of the domains, a Data Mesh\\narchitecture can contribute to improving the understanding\\nand trustworthiness of the data. Workshops or written value\\nstatements that showcase or describe these contributions can\\nhelp create support among top management.\\nE. Recommendations regarding Enterprise Ability\\nWith deficiencies in the enterprise ability to migrate, it is\\nrecommended to realize that decentralizing and decoupling\\ncurrent monolithic structures is a lengthy and iterative process.\\nRecommendations within this process are, for example, to start\\nidentifying the domains, and to consider how these domains\\ncan be enabled to work autonomously. Not all domains have\\nthe capability to work autonomously, so it is recommended\\nto start slowly with the domains that are the most mature\\nand eager to be autonomous. These domains can serve as an\\nexample and pilot study. Outlining the business domains on\\na map can help with the decentralization process, for example\\nbased on existing domains that already own business artifacts\\nor based on each vice president within the organization. Theownership boundaries are formulated so that the domains do\\nnot step on each other’s toes.\\nIn line with this, it is useful to realize that not every\\norganization is able to decouple the central platforms. For\\nthese organizations, a logical split in the domains can be\\nchosen, whereby each part of the central application belongs\\nto one domain. Perform a translation which allows to\\ndecouple the operational plane from the analytical plan in this\\napplication, so that an abstraction layer is created between\\nbusiness application and analytical application.\\nFinally, the ability to work in domain teams can be\\nincreased by looking closely at the demand or data engineering\\nskills in each domain. Not all domains have a constant\\nworkload over time, so at the beginning of the migration it\\nis possible to work with, for example, a center of excellence\\nof a pool of people who are able to jump into domain\\nproblems. It is recommended to retain a certain amount of\\ndomain knowledge within the data engineers. In addition,\\na migration program could be established that redesigns the\\nentire organization based on domains and processes around\\nthe domains. This program is carried across the organization\\nas a whole and ensures that the most important concepts - such\\nas the definition of a data product, how you publish, how you\\nmanage data - are clear and understandable to the people who\\nbecome part of a domain.\\nF . Recommendations regarding Clearly defined Roles and\\nResponsibilities\\nFirstly, if there is a shortcoming within this dimension,\\nit is recommended to realize that not everything has to be\\nperfectly defined, but that there is a clear ownership alignment\\namong the domains and the organization as a whole. A data\\nproduct manager in any domain should have the information\\nwhat the data product means, and know and understand the\\ndata product. This improves trust in data products between\\nthe different domains. Certain roles that could be divided\\nin this context are, for example, those of a data owner in\\nterms of business insights, a data custodian in terms of IT\\nresponsibilities and a data steward as data product manager\\nand to bridge the gap between both teams.\\nG. Recommendations regarding Governance\\nIt has become clear from this study that few\\nrecommendations can be made in the field of setting up\\nthe governance model correctly. Recommendations were to\\nfocus on making it easy to share and access data within the\\nData Mesh architecture, within the regulatory boundaries.\\nAutomation and tools help with this, but are not necessary. In\\naddition, a central governance body is needed that can enforce\\nthe organization-wide standards and rules across the domains.\\nWithin the domains, governance must ensure that the data\\nis correctly defined and placed within the correct business\\ncontext. Possibilities for realizing democratized governance\\nare, for example, with a governance forum in which the\\ndomains can provide input and be part of the decision-making\\nprocess. Formal governance can be made available on this\\nforum so that certain policies are discoverable. From the\\ntechnology perspective, components can be built into the\\nplatform that can apply certain automated rules and policies.\\n8', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 136}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='H. Recommendations regarding Workable Approach\\nIf there is a shortcoming within the workable approach\\ndimension, the needs of the cross-domain collaboration could\\nbe looked at with regard to communication and collaboration.\\nThis can be done through data exchange, recurring meetings\\nor collaboration agreements. With many inter-domain\\ndependencies, data contracts or service level agreements can\\nbe drawn up to improve reliability. It is also possible to look\\nat a place in the organization, physical or digital, where this\\ninner- and cross-domain collaboration can take place.\\nWith regard to data literacy, it depends on the choice\\nof technology within the organization. With more complex\\ntechnology choices, it is more important to have a greater\\ndegree of data literacy. You can also opt for more modern\\ntools that do not require data engineers. Data literacy can be\\nimproved through a knowledge sharing platform, data literacy\\nworkshops or data awareness programs.\\nI. Recommendations regarding IT Capacity\\nIn case of shortcomings in IT capacity, it is recommended\\nto prioritize. Where continuous integration and automation\\nstandards have not been applied, it does not have the highest\\npriority to develop them. Continuous deployment is more\\nimportant when it comes to managing multiple data products.\\nIn addition, it is possible to look at developing approaches that\\ncounteract breaking use cases for downstream users, in case\\nof changes to existing datasets. In addition, it is also up to the\\ndomains themselves to determine with which maturity in terms\\nof CI/CD and automation they want to work on their inner-\\ndomain processes. Important to start with are data product\\npublication standards. If they don’t exist yet, they should be\\nset up to structure this process. These standards contain, for\\nexample, APIs for the structure of data, data contracts for the\\ntrust in the data, a description of the data so that consumers\\ncan use the data, or a technology standard with which data\\nproducts can be built.\\nJ. Recommendations regarding Enterprise Capacity\\nIn case of shortcomings in the Enterprise Capacity\\ndimension, it is recommended to start by recording the new\\nteam structures. A certain alignment with the business\\ndomains is suggested, because in this way business domain\\nknowledge can be preserved within the Data Mesh domains.\\nFor example, this domain knowledge can come in useful when\\nfeeling the responsibility about the domains, and it can be\\neasier to feel this responsibility if it already existed for a\\ncertain part of the business. In addition, this way of structuring\\nensures that the Data Mesh domains are not placed too far from\\nthe business.\\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\\nWhen determining readiness for a Data Mesh migration, the\\nData Mesh Readiness Model offers guidance in assessing the\\nas-is situation of organizations, and aims to mobilize decision-\\nmakers to start their migration by providing insights to what\\nimprovement areas to focus on. These insights are based on\\nthe perspective that a Data Mesh architecture mainly revolves\\naround the organizational structure, architectural decisions for\\nmoving data, and the supporting governance for it. The choiceof enabling technology is rather an executive decision than an\\norganizational priority.\\nThe two-dimensional design of the Data Mesh Readiness\\nModel is based on organizational steps towards readiness,\\nmeasured on a scale of various technological dimensions.\\nUsing this two-dimensional scope, the entire socio-technical\\nenvironment with respect to Data Mesh readiness can be\\nincluded during the assessment of the model. The dimensions\\nand associated readiness influencing factors are based on\\nempirical data from exploratory interviews, model refinement\\nsessions, refinement evaluation sessions, case studies, test\\ncases and evaluation sessions. By demonstrating and testing\\nthe model in practice, insight has been created about a set\\nof practical recommendations for organizations experiencing\\nshortcomings in one of the model dimensions. These\\nrecommendations are based on the empirical data from the\\nparticipants within this research and their approaches towards\\nData Mesh readiness.\\nIX. FUTURE RESEARCH\\nFirst, the model in this study has been demonstrated in\\na number of different environments. Since the exploratory\\ninterviews and the case studies have shown that the readiness\\nof organizations depends on contextual influences, it would\\nbe of added value to apply the model in more different\\ncontexts. Involving more different use cases could contribute\\nto a broadened understanding of the readiness of organizations\\ntowards Data Mesh migration and how the influencing factors\\nrelate to it. For example, an application within a risk-averse\\nand heavily government-regulated sector such as healthcare\\ncould provide interesting insights. The contexts within this\\nresearch were often less regulated and more data-driven.\\nSecond, an empirical follow-up study could focus more on\\nrecruiting more critical participants in the study. Because the\\ntopic is currently very popular among data-driven enthusiasts,\\nit was difficult to find participants who could express\\nthemselves critically towards the topic and who also had\\nempirical evidence for this. Follow-up research could take\\nplace in the future if there are more practical examples of Data\\nMesh implementations and their critics.\\nThird, follow-up research could focus on the factors\\nthat had little consensus during the case studies, such\\nas establishing an appropriate governance model for Data\\nMesh architectures or addressing the decentralization and\\ndecoupling process. While this study has provided an\\noverview of the as-is situation of participating organizations\\nand offered different perspectives, follow-up research can\\ndelve deeper into these topics and explore the best ways to\\naddress these factors. For example, a Design Science Research\\ninto the design and development of a Data Mesh governance\\nmodel could be of added value.\\nFourth, follow-up research could focus on designing and\\ndeveloping an execution framework for implementing a Data\\nMesh architecture. While this research mainly focused on\\nreadiness and preparation prior to implementation, follow-up\\nresearch can take a look at an actual implementation process of\\na Data Mesh architecture. Specific attention could be paid to\\ncertain implementation challenges that flow from the readiness\\nassessment, or tackling the identified areas of improvement in\\n9', metadata={'source': '/content/Data_Mesh.pdf', 'page': 137}),\n",
